This repo holds various Docker images for running Cypress locally and in CI.

There are Docker images:

- `cypress/base:<Node version>` has the operating system dependencies required
  to run Cypress.
- `cypress/browsers:<tag>` extends the base images with pre-installed browsers.
- `cypress/included:<Cypress version>` extends the base images with
  pre-installed Cypress versions.
- `cypress/factory:<tag>` is a docker image that can be used with docker args to
  generate a docker container with specific versions of node, yarn, chrome,
  firefox, edge and cypress. It is used to create the above docker images and
  can be used by you to create a custom docker image with versions of your
  choice.
