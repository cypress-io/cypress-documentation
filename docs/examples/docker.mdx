This repo holds the documentation, build and publish code for various Docker images for running Cypress locally and in CI.

The following types of Cypress Docker images are available:

- [cypress/base](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/tree/master/base)`:<Node version>`
  has the operating system dependencies required to run Cypress.
- [cypress/browsers](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/tree/master/browsers)`:<tag>`
  extends the base images with pre-installed browsers.
- [cypress/included](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/tree/master/included)`:<Cypress version>`
  extends the browsers images with pre-installed Cypress versions.
- [cypress/factory](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/tree/master/factory)`:<Factory version>`
  is a Docker image that can be used with [`ARG`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#arg) instructions
  in a custom-built [`Dockerfile`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/) to generate a new Docker image
  with specific versions of Node.js, Yarn v1 Classic, Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Cypress.
  It's used to create the above Docker images and can
  be used by you to create a custom Docker image with versions of your choice.
