## Kitchen Sink

/>

This is an example app which is used to showcase every command available in
Cypress.

- Query and traverse DOM elements using [cy.get()](/api/commands/get),
  [cy.find()](/api/commands/find) and other commands.
- [.type()](/api/commands/type) into forms, [.click()](/api/commands/click)
  elements, [.select()](/api/commands/select) dropdowns, and other actions.
- Change the size of the viewport using [cy.viewport()](/api/commands/viewport).
- Navigate to other pages.
- [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) network requests,
  [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait) on responses, and stub response data using
  [cy.fixture()](/api/commands/fixture).
- Inspect and manipulate cookies and localStorage.

## TodoMVC

/>

This repo compares
[Cypress Tests](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-todomvc/blob/master/cypress/e2e/app.cy.js)
to
[official TodoMVC Tests](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/tests/test.js).
This gives you a good comparison of writing and running tests in Cypress versus
vanilla Selenium.

- Query and make assertions about DOM elements state.
- Type into an input using [cy.type()](/api/commands/type).
- Create a custom `cy.createTodo()` command to run multiple cy commands.
- Click and double click elements using [cy.click()](/api/commands/click) and
  [cy.dblclick()](/api/commands/dblclick).

## Realworld

<Icon
  name="github"
  url="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-realworld"
/>

Shows a full blogging application, "Conduit", with back end code and a database.

- Create a test user from tests by running database commands via the
  [cy.task()](/api/commands/task) command.
- Log in using [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) and then setting the
  returned JWT token in `localStorage`.
- Test all aspects of writing blog posts, commenting, and marking favorite
  posts.
- Collect full stack code coverage using
  [@cypress/code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage). Read
  the Cypress [code coverage guide](/guides/tooling/code-coverage) for more
  details.
