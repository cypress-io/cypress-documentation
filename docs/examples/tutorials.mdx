## Best Practices

This video by the creator of Cypress Brian Mann shows what we consider the best
practices for writing tests for a realistic application.

First we'll test our "Login Page", refactor, and then create a
[Custom Command](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands). From there we'll use
[`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) to programmatically log in. Finally,
we'll discuss approaches for taking shortcuts by controlling your application's
state directly, and for writing your tests **in isolation** to prevent specs
from being coupled together or having to share knowledge.
