If you are running the tests from within a restrictive VPN you will need to allow some URLs so that Cypress can have effective communication with Cypress Cloud.

**The URLs are the following:**

- `https://api.cypress.io` - **Cypress API**
- `https://assets.cypress.io` - **Asset CDN** (Org logos, icons, videos,
  screenshots, etc.)
- `https://authenticate.cypress.io` - **Authentication API**
- `https://capture.cypress.io` - **Cypress Test Replay**
- `https://s3.amazonaws.com/capture.cypress.io` - **Uploading Cypress Test Replay from Test Runner**
- `https://cloud.cypress.io` - **Cypress Cloud**
- `https://docs.cypress.io` - **Cypress documentation**
- `https://download.cypress.io` - **CDN download of Cypress binary**
- `https://on.cypress.io` - **URL shortener for link redirects**

**If you are using GitHub Enterprise or GitLab for Enterprise (Self-managed), you may also need to add the following to the version control IP allowlist:**

- `3.211.102.119` - **Dedicated IP**
- `18.213.72.78` - **Dedicated IP**
- `35.169.145.173` - **Dedicated IP**
- `44.199.152.70` - **Dedicated IP**
- `52.70.95.89` - **Dedicated IP**
