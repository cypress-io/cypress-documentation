<Icon name="check-circle" color="green" /> **Benefits:** Stopping a test run on the
first failure across parallelized machines will:

1. **Save time.** Identify failures early and resolve issues faster.
2. **Reduce CI costs.** Cut down on unnecessary test execution, leading to significant savings for large test suites.
3. **Free up CI resources.** Prioritize critical tests and keep CI pipelines available for validating fixes.
4. **Optimize future runs.** With **[Spec Prioritization](/cloud/features/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization)** and **Auto Cancellation**, failed tests run first in the next attempt, stopping early if issues persist to maximize efficiency.
