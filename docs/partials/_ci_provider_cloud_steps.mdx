Ideally this whole content section would be a dynamic component with the provider as props.
However a toc/render issue would prevent this from loading/displaying correctly on the page.

TODO: reuse this bulk of text for now until the Docusaurus v3 refactor.

1. [Recording test results with the `--record` flag](https://on.cypress.io/how-do-i-record-runs)
   to Cypress Cloud.

   - In-depth and shareable
     [test reports](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs#Latest-Runs).
   - Visibility into test failures via quick access to [Test Replay](/guides/cloud/test-replay), error messages, stack
     traces, screenshots, videos, and contextual details.
   - [Integrating testing with the pull-request (PR) process](/guides/cloud/integrations/source-control/github)
     via
     [commit status check guards](/guides/cloud/integrations/source-control/github#Status-checks)
     and convenient
     [test report comments](/guides/cloud/integrations/source-control/github#Pull-request-comments).
   - [Detecting flaky tests](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management) and surfacing
     them via [Slack alerts](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management#Slack) or
     [GitHub PR status checks](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management#GitHub).

2. [Parallelizing test runs](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization)
   and optimizing their execution via
   [intelligent load-balancing](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/load-balancing#Balance-strategy)
   of test specs across CI machines with the `--parallel` flag.

3. Organizing and consolidating multiple `cypress run` calls by labeled groups
   into a single report within [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud). In
   the example above we use the `--group UI-Chrome` flag to organize all UI tests for the Chrome browser into a group labeled "UI-Chrome" inside the Cypress Cloud report.
