## Component Testing Config

Below are a few additional configuration values that are specific to component
testing.

### Custom Dev Server

A custom function can be passed into the `devServer` option, which allows the
use of other dev servers not provided by Cypress out of the box. These can be
from the Cypress community, preview builds not included with the app, or a
custom one you create.

The function's signature takes in a
[Cypress Configuration](/app/references/configuration) object as its only
parameter and returns either an instance of a `devServer` or a promise that
resolves to a `devServer` instance.

<cypress-config-file>
<template js>

```js
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  component: {
    devServer(cypressConfig) {
      // return devServer instance or a promise that resolves to
      // a dev server here
      return {
        port: 1234,
        close: () => {},
      }
    },
  },
})
```

</template>
<template ts>

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'

export default defineConfig({
  component: {
    devServer(cypressConfig: CypressConfiguration) {
      // return devServer instance or a promise that resolves to
      // a dev server here
      return {
        port: 1234,
        close: () => {},
      }
    },
  },
})
```

</template>
</cypress-config-file>

### Custom Index File

By default, Cypress renders your components into an HTML file located at
`cypress/support/component-index.html`.

The index file allows you to add in global assets, such as styles, fonts, and
external scripts.

You can provide an alternative path to the file using the `indexHtmlFile` option
in the [component config](/app/references/configuration#component) options:

```js
{
  component: {
    devServer,
    indexHtmlFile: '/custom/path/to/component-index.html'
  }
}
```

### Spec Pattern for Component Tests

By default, Cypress looks for spec files anywhere in your project with an
extension of `.cy.js`, `.cy.jsx`, `.cy.ts`, or `.cy.tsx`. However, you can
change this behavior for component tests with a custom `specPattern` value. In
the following example, we've configured Cypress to look for spec files with
those same extensions, but only in the `src` folder or any of its
subdirectories.

```js
{
  component: {
    specPattern: 'src/**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'
  }
}
```

### Additional Config

[configuration reference](/app/references/configuration).
