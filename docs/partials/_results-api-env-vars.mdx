The `@cypress/extract-cloud-results` helper cross-references some environment variables from where it is executed with ones that were present when a Cypress Cloud run was recorded. This allows for automatically detecting the correct Cloud run when the Results API is invoked from the same CI context as a given run (as is the case in the above examples).

For more complex setups, or for local iteration on your Results API handler code, it can be useful to know what variables Cypress is looking for so that you can make sure they are passed through where they are needed.

Likewise, if you want to use the Results API locally to pull the data for a specific run (within the last 7 days), you can set these variables locally to match what was present in CI.

## Local development example

If you executed a run in GitHub Actions and it was recorded to Cypress Cloud, you would set these 4 environment variables to replicate the context of that run locally and execute your local handler script. This is a great way to iterate on your script and verify everything is working as expected, without having to integrate anything in CI. It's also useful for debugging.

```
CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID=AAA
CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY=BBB
GITHUB_ACTIONS=true
GITHUB_RUN_ID=111
GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT=0
node verifyAccessibilityResults.js
```

The Results API will then look for the Cypress Cloud run that matches this run ID. If there is more than one Cypress Cloud run found for that GitHub Actions Run, you can pass run tags to narrow down to one run's report.

## Supported CI Provider Overview

Each CI provider has a unique combination of components, patterns, and environment variables that must be interpreted by this module.

### GitHub Actions

Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions

#### Essential environment variables

- `GITHUB_ACTIONS` - Presence identifies the environment as a GitHub Actions environment.
- `GITHUB_RUN_ID` - Value uniquely identifies a GitHub Actions workflow instance. Value does not change as jobs in the workflow are re-executed.
- `GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT` - Value identifies the workflow instance's attempt index. Value is incremented each time jobs are re-executed.

Full environment variable reference: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables

#### Prerequisites

1. The run to validate and this module's validation script are being executed within the same workflow.
2. The module script is always executed _after_ the run to validate has been created. This can be achieved by either:
   1. Executing the module script in a separate job that is dependent upon the job that records the run (using the `needs: [job-name]` option in the config), or
   2. Executing the module script in serial with the cypress recording in the same job.

### GitLab Pipelines

Reference: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/

#### Essential environment variables

- `GITLAB_CI` - Presence identifies the environment as a GitLab CI environment
- `CI_PIPELINE_ID` - Value uniquely identifies a GitLab pipeline workflow. This value does not change as jobs in the pipeline are retried.
- `CI_JOB_NAME` - Value uniquely identifies a single job name within a pipeline. Ex. `run-e2e`
- `CI_JOB_ID` - Value uniquely identifies an execution instance of a job. This value will change each time a job is executed/re-executed.

Full environment variable reference: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html

#### Prerequisites

1. The run to validate and this module's validation script are being executed within the same pipeline.
2. The module script is always executed _after_ the run to validate has been created. This can be achieved by:
   1. Executing the module script in a separate job that is dependent upon the job that records the run (using the `needs: [job-name]` option in the config), or
   2. Executing the module script in a separate job that is executed in a lower stage than the job that records the Cypress run, or
   3. Executing the module script in serial with the cypress recording in the same job.

### Jenkins

Reference: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/

Jenkins is heavily customizable through the usage of plugins, which limits the amount of assumptions we can make about available environment variables and overall behavior.

We have implemented Jenkins support within this module using the broadest set of available default values. For the purposes of this documentation, though, we will discuss terms related to Jenkins Pipeline support: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/

#### Essential terms

#### Essential environment variables

- `JENKINS_HOME` - Presence identifies the environment as a Jenkins environment
- `BUILD_URL` - Value uniquely identifies a Jenkins job execution, including name and id characteristics.

Full environment variable reference: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#using-environment-variables

#### Prerequisites

1. The run to validate and this module's validation script are being executed within the same job.
2. The module script is always executed _after_ the run to validate has been created. This can be achieved by executing the module script in serial with the cypress recording in the same job.

### Azure

Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts?view=azure-devops

> Note: Cypress v13.13.1 is the earliest Cypress release that records the environment variables necessary for this module to identify runs in an Azure environment. Previous Cypress versions are not supported in Azure pipelines.

#### Essential environment variables

- `TF_BUILD` and `AZURE_HTTP_USER_AGENT` - Combined presence identifies the environment as a Azure pipeline environment.
- `SYSTEM_PLANID` - Value uniquely identifies a pipeline run. Value does not change as jobs within the pipeline are retried from failure.
- `SYSTEM_JOBID` - Value uniquely identifies a job execution. Value changes each time a job is retried from failure, in conjunction with the `SYSTEM_JOBATTEMPT` being incremented.
- `SYSTEM_JOBATTEMPT` - Value identifies the pipelines shared attempt index. Value is incremented when jobs are retried from failure.

Full environment variable reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml

#### Prerequisites

1. The run to validate and this module's validation script are being executed within the same pipeline run (i.e. they share a `SYSTEM_PLANID` value).
2. The module script is always executed _after_ the run to validate has been created. This can be achieved by either:
   1. Executing the module script in a separate job that is dependent upon the job that records the run (using the `dependsOn: [job-name]` option in the config), or
   2. Executing the module script in serial with the Cypress recording in the same job.

### CircleCI

Reference: https://circleci.com/docs/about-circleci/

> Note: Cypress v13.13.1 is the earliest Cypress release that records the environment variables necessary for this module to identify runs in an CircleCI environment. Previous Cypress versions are not supported in CircleCI pipelines.

#### Essential environment variables

- `CIRCLECI` - Presence identifies the environment as a CircleCI environment
- `CIRCLE_PIPELINE_ID` - Value uniquely identifies a CircleCI pipeline, created on push or manually triggered through the UI. This value does not change as workflows within the pipeline are re-executed.
- `CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID` - Value uniquely identifies an instance of a workflow's execution within a pipeline. This value will be updated upon each workflow execution; in other words, retrying a workflow from failure from the Circle UI will create a new workflow with a new `CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID` value available to the jobs executed within it.
- `CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_JOB_ID` - Value uniquely identifies an execution instance of a named job within a workflow instance.

Full environment variable reference: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html

#### Prerequisites

1. The run to validate and this module's validation script are being executed within the same pipeline **and** workflow.
2. The module script is always executed _after_ the run to validate has been created. This can be achieved by:
   1. Executing the module script in a separate job that is dependent upon the job that records the run (using the `requires: [job-name]` option in the config), or

In order to iterate on your verification script and see everything working without putting code into your CI environment, it can be useful to simulate the CI context for a specific Cypress run locally. This can save a lot of time when getting started.
