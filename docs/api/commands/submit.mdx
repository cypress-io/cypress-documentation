Submit a form.

It is [unsafe](/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability#Only-queries-are-retried) to
chain further commands that rely on the subject after `.submit()`.

:::caution

The [subject](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Subject-Management)
must be a `<form>`.

:::

## Syntax

```javascript
.submit()
.submit(options)
```

### Usage

**<Icon name="check-circle" color="green" /> Correct Usage**

```javascript
cy.get('form').submit() // Submit a form
```

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red" /> Incorrect Usage**

```javascript
cy.submit() // Errors, cannot be chained off 'cy'
cy.get('input').submit() // Errors, 'input' does not yield a form
```

### Arguments

**<Icon name="angle-right" /> options** **_(Object)_**

Pass in an options object to change the default behavior of `.submit()`.

| Option    | Default                                                              | Description                                                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `log`     | `true`                                                               | Displays the command in the [Command log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) |
| `timeout` | [`defaultCommandTimeout`](/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts) | Time to wait for `.submit()` to resolve before [timing out](#Timeouts)                   |

### Yields [<Icon name="question-circle"/>](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Subject-Management)

- `.submit()` yields the same subject it was given.
- It is [unsafe](/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability#Only-queries-are-retried)
  to chain further commands that rely on the subject after `.submit()`.

## Example

### No Args

#### Submit can only be called on a single form

```html
<form id="contact">
  <input type="text" name="message" />
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

```javascript
cy.get('#contact').submit()
```

## Notes

### Submit is not an action command

`.submit()` is not implemented like other action commands, and does not follow
the same rules of
[waiting for actionability](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements).

`.submit()` is a helpful command used as a shortcut. Normally a user has to
perform a different "action" to submit a form. It could be clicking a submit
`<button>`, or pressing `enter` on a keyboard.

Oftentimes using `.submit()` directly is more concise and conveys what you're
trying to test.

If you want the other guarantees of waiting for an element to become actionable,
you should use a different command like [`.click()`](/api/commands/click) or
[`.type()`](/api/commands/type).

### Submit will fail if there are form validation errors

If the form being submitted includes inputs with
[client-side validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)
and that validation fails, `.submit()` will fail and list the validation
failures.

## Rules

### Requirements [<Icon name="question-circle"/>](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Chains-of-Commands)

- `.submit()` requires being chained off a command that yields DOM element(s).
- `.submit()` requires the element to be a `form`.

### Assertions [<Icon name="question-circle"/>](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Assertions)

- `.submit()` will automatically wait for assertions you have chained to pass.

### Timeouts [<Icon name="question-circle"/>](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Timeouts)

- `.submit()` can time out waiting for assertions you've added to pass.

## Command Log

**_Submit a form_**

```javascript
cy.intercept('POST', '/users', { fixture: 'user' }).as('userSuccess')
cy.get('form').submit()
```

The commands above will display in the Command Log as:

  src="/img/api/submit/form-submit-shows-in-command-log-of-cypress.png"
  alt="Command Log submit"
></DocsImage>

When clicking on `submit` within the command log, the console outputs the
following:

  alt="Console Log submit"
