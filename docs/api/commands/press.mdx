# press

Dispatch a series of native key events to your application.

A keydown, press, and keyup event will be dispatched directly to the browser window. Note that your application must have focus to properly receive this event. It can be helpful to use `cy.focus()` to ensure focus on an element in your application before using this command.

This command is distinct from `cy.type()`: it is meant for non-character keys, will dispatch real keyboard events rather than simulated ones. Currently, the only key support is `Tab`.

This command is _not_ chainable, and does not return a value.

:::info

<strong>Supported Browsers:</strong>
This command is supported in chromium browsers, and Firefox versions beginning with
v135. Safari is not supported. This command will fail if executed in a browser that
does not support it.

:::caution

<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" /> **Transient activation**

By dispatching native keyboard events to the browser, this command will cause the browser to enter [Transient activation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Transient_activation) state.

If your application prevents the default behavior of the `beforeunload` event, this may cause issues when navigating away from the current page.

## Syntax

```javascript
cy.press(Cypress.Keyboard.Keys.TAB)
cy.press(Cypress.Keyboard.Keys.TAB, {
  log: false,
  timeout: 2000,
})
```

## Signature

```typescript
interface PressCommand {
  (
    key: KeyPressSupportedKeys,
    options?: Partial<Cypress.Loggable> & Partial<Cypress.Timeoutable>
  ): void
}
```

## Usage

<Icon name="check-circle" color="green" /> **Correct Usage**

```javascript
it('moves focus to the next form element when the user presses tab', function () {
  cy.visit('/my-form')
  cy.get('input.first').focus() // focusing the first form element ensures that the application will receive the events
  cy.press(Cypress.Keyboard.Keys.TAB)
  cy.get('input.second').should('have.focus')
})
```

<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red" /> **Incorrect Usage**

```javascript
it('moves focus to the next form element when the user presses tab', function () {
  cy.visit('/my-form')
  cy.press(Cypress.Keyboard.Keys.TAB) // the key event will be dispatched to the top frame, rather than your application
  cy.get('input.second').should('have.focus') // the key events did not get dispatched to the application, so the focus did not shift to the second form element.
})
```

### Arguments

<Icon name="angle-right" /> **key _(String)_**

The key to press. The supported values are available on `Cypress.Keyboard.Keys`, and may change from time to time. It is recomended that you reference these values from `Cypress.Keyboard.Keys` rather than passing in a string.

### Supported Keys

| Reference                   | Value   |
| --------------------------- | ------- |
| `Cypress.Keyboard.Keys.TAB` | `"Tab"` |

<Icon name="angle-right" /> **options _(Object)_**

The second `options` parameter is optional and standard for Cypress commands. It supports setting the timeout and/or whether to log the command:
