# Cypress.stop

Stop the Cypress App on the current machine while tests are running. This can be useful for stopping test execution upon failures or other predefined conditions.

:::tip

**Auto Cancellation**: If you're looking to automatically stop _all tests_ across _multiple machines_ when a test fails, consider using the [Auto Cancellation feature](/cloud/features/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation) in Cypress Cloud.

## Syntax

```javascript
Cypress.stop()
```

## Examples

### Stop tests when a test fails

To ensure tests stop immediately after a failure across any spec file, add the following snippet to your `support/index.js` file:

```javascript
afterEach(function () {
  if (this.currentTest.state === 'failed') {
    Cypress.stop()
  }
})
```

### Abort tests when a condition is met

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  if (env !== 'expected-condition') {
    cy.log('Stop tests - environment is not setup correctly')
    Cypress.stop()
  }
})
```

## Notes

### Why Choose Auto Cancellation?

[Auto Cancellation](/cloud/features/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation) is available with Cypress Cloud's Business+ plan. It offers several advantages over `Cypress.stop` for stopping tests on **failure**:

1. **Scope of Cancellation:** `Cypress.stop` halts only the current spec file, skipping remaining tests within it. Auto Cancellation, however, stops all tests across all machines and marks the entire run as **cancelled** in Cypress Cloud for better visibility.
2. **Configurable Thresholds:** Auto Cancellation allows you to define failure thresholds. `Cypress.stop` executes immediately when the specified condition is met.
3. **Simplified Configuration**: Auto Cancellation settings can be managed in Cypress Cloud, whereas `Cypress.stop` requires manual code changes.
4. **Optimization with Spec Prioritization**: Combined with [Spec Prioritization](/cloud/features/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization) (another Business+ feature), Auto Cancellation helps efficiently allocate resources by running previously failing specs first in a new run.
