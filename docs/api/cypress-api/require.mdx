title: Cypress.require
e2eSpecific: true
---

`Cypress.require` enables utilizing dependencies within the
[`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) callback function. It is used to require
modules such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages and other local files.

It is functionally the same as using
[CommonJS `require()`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#requireid)
in browser-targeted code.

## Syntax

:::caution

Using `Cypress.require()` within the [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin)
callback requires enabling the
[`experimentalOriginDependencies`](/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing) option in the Cypress configuration.

:::

```js
Cypress.require(moduleNameOrPath)
```

## Usage

<Icon name="check-circle" color="green"></Icon> **Correct Usage**

```js
cy.origin('cypress.io', () => {
  const _ = Cypress.require('lodash')
  const utils = Cypress.require('./utils')

  // ... use lodash and utils ...
})
```

<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> **Incorrect Usage**

```js
// `Cypress.require()` cannot be used outside the `cy.origin()` callback.
// Use CommonJS `require()` instead
const _ = Cypress.require('lodash')

cy.origin('cypress.io', async () => {
  // `require()` and `import()` cannot be used inside the `cy.origin()` callback.
  // Use `Cypress.require()` instead
  const _ = require('lodash')
  const utils = await import('./utils')
})
```

See
[`cy.origin()` Dependencies / Sharing Code](/api/commands/origin#Dependencies--Sharing-Code)
for more example usage.

## TypeScript

There are couple ways to have types inferred for the dependency required.

### Casting

```js
cy.origin('cypress.io', async () => {
  const _ = Cypress.require('lodash') as typeof import('lodash')

  // lodash methods are properly typed
  _.map([1, 2, 3], (num: number) => {
    // ...
  })
})
```

### Generic

```js
import type { LoDashStatic } from 'lodash'

cy.origin('cypress.io', async () => {
  const _ = Cypress.require < LoDashStatic > 'lodash'

  // lodash methods are properly typed
  _.map([1, 2, 3], (num: number) => {
    // ...
  })
})
```

## Limitations / Requirements

- `Cypress.require` only works when called within the
  [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) callback function. It will error if used
  elsewhere.
- Only the following file extensions are supported for dependencies required
  (either directly or indirectly):
  - `.js`
  - `.jsx`
  - `.ts`
  - `.tsx`
  - `.mjs`
  - `.json`
  - `.coffee`
- `Cypress.require('dependency-name')` must on one line as a continuous string:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```js
// ✅ GOOD
Cypress.require('lodash')

// ❌ BAD
const { require } = Cypress
require('lodash')

// ❌ BAD
Cypress
.require('lodash')

// ❌ BAD
Cypress . require('lodash')

// ❌ BAD
Cypress.require(
  'lodash'
)
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Why not `require` or `import`?

Cypress runs test code in the browser, so any dependencies have to be bundled
with the test code before it is run. This is accomplished for the majority of
test code via a [preprocessor](/api/plugins/preprocessors-api). However, due to
the way that [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) works, the callback passed to
it is extracted from the test code where it is defined and run in a different
context. This also separates it from any dependencies that are included in the
test code bundle.

To solve this, we replace all instances of `Cypress.require` with `require` at
runtime and bundle just the callback with any dependencies required within it.

Using `Cypress.require` in the test code instead of `require` or `import` keeps
the dependencies required within the callback from being bundled with the rest
of the test code. We cannot bring them along with the callback to where it is
run, so it would waste execution time and memory to bundle its dependencies in
the original preprocessing. The dependencies are only bundled with the code that
needs them when we preprocess the callback itself.

Additionally, we tried a solution previously that allowed use of `require` and
`import`, but found that it hurt performance not only for spec files using them
within the `cy.origin()` callback, but even for spec files that did not use
them. That solution was also preprocessor-dependent and only worked for the
webpack preprocessor. Using `Cypress.require` is preprocessor-agnostic.
