## Commands

Cypress commands don't do anything at the moment they are invoked, but rather
enqueue themselves to be run later. Commands can be chained commands together
because Cypress manages a Promise chain on your behalf, with each command
yielding a 'subject' to the next command, until the chain ends or an error is
encountered.

Learn more about how commands chain together in the
[Introduction to Chains of Commands](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Chains-of-Commands).

Cypress commands can be classified one of the following

- `query` - commands that read the state of your application
- `assertion` - command which assert on a given state
- `action` - interact with your application as a user would
- `other` - any other command that is useful for writing tests

The differences between queries and other commands are outline in the
[Retry-ability Guide](/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability).

### Queries

Queries are Cypress commands that read the state of your application. They
return a subject for further commands to act or assert on, and retry as needed
to make sure the DOM element or other data they yield is always up to date.

### Assertions

Assertions are Cypress commands that assert on the state of your application.
They pause your test until the given condition is met, or until they time out.
Learn more about Cypress assertions in the
[Introduction to Assertions](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Assertions)
and the [Assertions Reference](/guides/references/assertions).

| [`.and()`](/api/commands/and)       | Alias for `.should(). Assert on the state of your application`.                                            |
| [`.should()`](/api/commands/should) | Assert on the state of your application. Assertions are automatically retried until they pass or time out. |

### Actions

Actions are Cypress commands that interact with your application as a user
would. They wait for elements to be actionable before interacting with the page.

[Actionability Guide](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements).

## Cypress API

### Events

Cypress emits a series of events as it runs in your browser. These events are
useful not only to control your application's behavior, but also for debugging
purposes. Learn more about them in the
[Catalog of Events](/api/cypress-api/catalog-of-events).

### Custom Commands and Queries

Cypress exposes interfaces to write
[Custom Commands](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands) and
[Custom Queries](/api/cypress-api/custom-queries). See those pages for more
details.

The Cypress community has created a large number of

<a href="/plugins#custom-commands">Command Plugins</a> which you can install or download.

### APIs

Cypress exposes a number of properties and methods on the global `Cypress`
object.

The _key_ difference between Cypress APIs and Cypress commands is that Cypress
APIs execute the moment they are invoked and are **not** enqueued to run at a
later time.

| [After Run Event](/api/plugins/after-run-api)               | The `after:run` event fires after a run is finished. When running cypress via cypress open, the event will fire when closing a project.                                                                                                                                     |
| [After Screenshot Event](/api/plugins/after-screenshot-api) | After a screenshot is taken, you can get details about it via the `after:screenshot` plugin event.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [After Spec Event](/api/plugins/after-spec-api)             | The `after:spec` event fires after a spec file is run. When running cypress via cypress open, the event will fire when the browser closes.                                                                                                                                  |
| [Before Run Event](/api/plugins/before-run-api)             | The `before:run` event fires before a run starts. When running cypress via cypress open, the event will fire when opening a project.                                                                                                                                        |
| [Before Spec Event](/api/plugins/before-spec-api)           | The `before:spec` event fires before a spec file is run. When running cypress via cypress open, the event will fire when the browser launches.                                                                                                                              |
| [Browser Launch API](/api/plugins/browser-launch-api)       | Before Cypress launches a browser, it gives you the opportunity to modify the browser preferences, install extensions, add and remove command-line arguments, and modify other options from the [`setupNodeEvents`](/guides/tooling/plugins-guide#Using-a-plugin) function. |
| [Configuration API](/api/plugins/configuration-api)         | Cypress enables you to dynamically modify configuration values and environment variables from your Cypress configuration.                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Preprocessors API](/api/plugins/preprocessors-api)         | A preprocessor is the plugin responsible for preparing a support file or a test file for the browser. A preprocessor also typically watches the source files for changes, processes them again, and then notifies Cypress to re-run the tests.                              |
