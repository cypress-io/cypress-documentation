Organizations are used to group and manage projects. Here you can create
projects, manage users, access billing and usage information, leverage third
party integrations, and apply org-level settings.

## Organization ID

An Organization's ID is a unique identifier in
[UUID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) format that can be found under the
"Organization settings" section of Cypress Cloud. This ID is used frequently by
the Support, Success, and Sales teams to reference an Organization.

To locate your Organization's ID, go to "Organization settings" then
Organization ID. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the ID for easy sharing
with Cypress teams.

## Managing Organizations

[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) by opening the organization
switcher and clicking **<Icon name="plus" /> Create new organization**.

### Delete Org

You can delete organizations that you own as long as they do not have any
projects in the organization. You must first
[delete](/cloud/account-management/projects#Delete-Project) or
[transfer ownership](/cloud/account-management/projects#Transfer-ownership)
of your projects your projects to another organization before you can delete the
organization.
