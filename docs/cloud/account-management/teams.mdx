Teams can be defined in Cypress Cloud. A team can help you control which users have
access to specific projects. This is accomplished by selecting which projects a team
is allowed to access.

Organizations have many reasons for wanting to divide access into teams. Some of the most
popular reasons are:

- Increase efficiency and reduce clutter by only seeing the projects that you need to see
- Multiple business units in your organization are sharing the same Cypress Cloud organization
- Privacy and security when certain projects are only meant to be accessible to specific users
  in an organization
- Ability to understand Cypress usage, by team, in [Enterprise Reporting](/cloud/features/analytics/enterprise-reporting)

_Note: [public projects](https://on.cypress.io/what-is-project-access) are visible to all users in the organization in Cypress Cloud_

## Manage teams

Organization [owner or admin](/cloud/account-management/users#User-roles) roles can create
teams in Cypress Cloud. These organization owners and admins, along with a new role called
the _team admin_, are then able to configure the team as required.

- There is no limit on the number of teams that can be set up for your organization
- All users in Cypress Cloud will be a member of the default team named _Everyone_
- A user can be assigned to multiple teams
- Roles are defined at the user level. That user's role determines the permissions granted
  within the team
- There is no limit on the number of projects that can be assigned to a team
- The same project can be assigned to multiple teams
- Having access to a project in Cypress Cloud has no bearing on whether or not a Cypress App user can record runs to Cypress Cloud

### Create or delete teams

Only organization [owner or admin](/cloud/account-management/users#User-roles) roles can create
teams in Cypress Cloud. Other roles will not see the button to create a new team.

1. On the Users & Teams page, select the _Teams_ tab
2. Click **+ Create team**

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/cloud/teams/create-new-team.png"
     alt="Nagivate to the Users & Teams page and see a button to create a new team."
   />

3. On the _Create new team_ modal, enter the team name and click **Save**

_Note: team names must be unique_

To delete a team, simply click on the _X_ icon at the right side of the team's row.
You will be prompted for confirmation before the team is deleted.

### Assign projects to a team

Once a team has been created, it is important to assign projects to the team. If no
projects are assigned to a team, any users that are a member of only this team will not
have access to Cypress Cloud projects.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/cloud/teams/assign-projects-to-team.png"
  alt="Click the + icon to assign projects to a team."
/>

On the _Teams_ tab, assign projects to a team by clicking the **+** icon in the
_Project access_ column. In the modal that appears there will be two options:

1. Assign all projects to team

   Use this option if you have a team that should access all projects, including projects that
   already exist and ones that will be created in the future. This is the default selection for
   the _Everyone_ team.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/cloud/teams/assign-projects-to-team-modal-all.png"
     alt="When assigning projects to a team, you can select All Projects that either exist or that may be created in the future."
   />

2. Assign selected projects to team

   Use this option if you want to assign specific projects to a team. Search for projects by name
   and select (or unselect) them to assign projects to the team.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/cloud/teams/assign-projects-to-team-modal-selected.png"
     alt="When assigning projects to a team, you can select individual projects from a list."
   />

### Assign users to a team

Once a team has been created and granted access to projects, the last step is to add
users to the team. This will allow the users to have access to the projects in Cypress Cloud.
There are two places in Cypress Cloud where users can be added to an existing team.

1. On the _Teams_ tab, select users for a team by clicking the **+** icon in the _Members_ column

   This makes it easy to add multiple users to a team at the same time. Simply browse the user list
   or search by name, and then select (or unselect) them to assign users as members of this team.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/cloud/teams/assign-members-to-team.png"
     alt="Click the + icon to assign Cypress Cloud users to a team."
   />
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/cloud/teams/assign-members-to-team-modal.png"
     alt="When assigning users to a team, you can select individual users from a list."
   />

2. On the _Users_ tab, select teams for a user by clicking the **+** icon in the _Teams_ column

   You can manage the team(s) assigned to a user directly on the _Users_ page. On the edit modal
   you you can search by team name and then select (or unselect) them to assign the user to
   additional teams.

   _Note: The label 'No project access' will appear if a team has not yet been configured to have
   access to any projects. This will help you avoid mistakes when assigning users to teams._

     alt="Click the + icon to assign a team to a specific user."
   />

   />

## Best practices

Separating project access between multiple teams in Cypress Cloud is an optional setup. If your
organization has no concerns or reasons to define teams, simply keep the default _Everyone_ team
as it is defined. All users added to Cypress Cloud will automatically be associated with the
Everyone team, and that team has access to all projects.

For organizations that have a desire to divide into teams, a common setup is as follows:

1. Create a team that will be assigned to all organization-level users (Owner or Admin) and assign
   all projects to this team. This will provide visibility to all projects to your organization-level users.

   - For example: create a team named 'Admins' and give it access to all projects. Then assign any
     existing and new organization-level users to this team.

2. Create teams that will align with your organizational structure and teams. It may be tempting to create
   a lot of teams with access to very specific projects, but that can increase your maintenance over time.

3. Once teams have been created, choose at least one member of each team who can be assigned the **Team admin**
   role. This will allow users who are regular participants of the team to perform administration tasks for the
   projects. It also removes this responsibility from your organization-level Admins and Owners.

4. After teams have been configured, you can remove the _All projects_ assignment from the _Everyone_ team.
   This will enforce your new team structure since users are no longer receiving project access from the default
   _Everyone_ team.

5. Ensure that all users have access to at least one project. This is easiest to see on the **Users** page
   where labels will appear in the _Teams_ columns if a user is not assigned to any teams, or if a user is
   assigned only to teams which cannot access projects. Remember: public projects are outside the scope of Teams
   and will always be visible to all users in your organization.

6. When a new project is created, make sure that it is granted access to one or more teams.

   - The new project will automatically be accessible to all users in a team assigned to _All projects_
   - Cypress is considering an additional feature to require a user who creates a new project to select teams
     at the time of project creation.
