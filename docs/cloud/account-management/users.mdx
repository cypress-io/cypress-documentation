:::

A user is anyone who logs in to Cypress Cloud.

## Invite users

Organization [owner or admin](#User-roles) roles can invite
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) users. Those invited will see
the projects and tests the user has [team permissions](/cloud/account-management/teams#Assign-projects-to-a-team)
to view.

_Note: only owners can give other users 'owner' access._

### Invite a user to an organization:

1. Select the [organization](/cloud/account-management/organizations) you
   want to invite a user to.
2. Click **Users & Teams**, then **Invite User**.
3. Add one or more emails, pressing **Enter** after each one, and select their [role](#User-roles).
4. Click **Invite User**.
5. The user will receive an invitation email with a link to accept the invitation.

If you prefer to send your own message to users and include a link to join the organization,
you can click **Copy invite link** and all users who accept this invitation will be given
the default role of **Member**.

## User roles

Users can be assigned roles that affect their access to certain features of
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud).

- **Viewer:** Can see projects and runs but not make any changes.
- **Member:** Can see projects, runs, record keys, and adjust App Quality configuration.
- **Team Admin:** Can manage the member list for projects where the Team Admin is a member, and edit project configurations.
- **Org Admin:** Can manage all users within the organization, and edit both organization and project configurations.
- **Org Owner:** Can manage all aspects of the organization and projects.

## User requests

Cypress App users can "request" access to a given organization. If a developer on
your team has access to Cypress and your project's source code - they can request
to be given access to your organization from within the Cypres App. This means
instead of you having to invite team members up front, they can request access and
you can choose to accept or deny them access.

_Note: this option is not available if your Cloud organization is configured for SSO._

## User updates

To change a user email, an **Owner** or **Admin** can invite the new user/email
address and delete the previous user/email address.

Update the billing email address via the **Billing & Usage** page within
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) or by contacting
[billing@cypress.io](mailto:billing@cypress.io) directly.
