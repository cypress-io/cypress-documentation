:::info

##### <Icon name="question-circle" color="#4BBFD2" /> What you'll learn

- How to view Cloud billing and usage information
- How to view usage of Cy.prompt AI
- How to request an Open Source Plan

:::

Billing and usage information can be found in the Cypress Cloud under the **Billing & Usage** section.
Here you can view your current plan, usage, and billing information.

## Cloud test results

The **Test results** card highlights the number of used and included test results in your current billing period.
It will also show how many additional test results have been purchased and used, if applicable.

<DocsImage

  alt="Billing and Usage Results shows visuals of usage in your current billing period"
/>

Click the **Usage details** button in order to view graphs of your test results usage.

### Usage over time

The **Detailed** tab shows your usage over time during the selected billing period.

  alt="A graph is displayed showing Test Result usage over time for your selected billing period"
/>

### Usage by project

The **By project** tab shows your usage per project during the selected billing period. Click the **CSV** button to download
your results usage for further analysis.

## Prompt executions

The **AI Prompts** card highlights the usage of [cy.prompt](/api/commands/prompt) AI in your organization.
See our [documentation on cy.prompt](/api/commands/prompt) to learn about its natural language and self-healing capabilities!

<DocsImage
  src="/img/cloud/billing/billing-and-usage-prompt-info.jpg"
  alt="Hover over the info icon to see AI cy.prompt usage"
/>

Hover over the **info icon** next to the number of prompt steps used to see a summarized breakdown of the usage.

The "Prompt execution" information conveys how many times the [cy.prompt](/api/commands/prompt) command has been executed in your organization,
either on developer machines or in CI. Each [cy.prompt](/api/commands/prompt) command can define more than one step to be executed.
We also break down the number of commands that took place in "Open mode" or in "Run mode". This enables you
to understand where [cy.prompt](/api/commands/prompt) AI is being leveraged in your organization.

Click the **Usage details** button in order to view graphs of your cy.prompt AI usage.

### Usage over time

The **Detailed** tab shows your prompt usage over time during the selected billing period.
