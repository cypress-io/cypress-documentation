- How to enable Spec Prioritization in Cypress Cloud
- How to save time by running failed specs first
- How to reduce CI costs by using Spec Prioritization with Auto Cancellation

:::

It is often helpful to be **aware of test failures earlier within a CI test run
so that debugging and iterations can resume and progress much faster**. Being
able to catch issues sooner within the CI process can save valuable time in
troubleshooting failures and deploying fixes.

For example, consider you have a test suite consisting of several spec files that take **30
minutes** to execute, but failures start to occur within one spec at the **20 minute**
marker. A subsequent code change aimed at resolving the issue will have to be
validated after running the CI build and waiting **20 minutes**. This process and
waiting continues until the issue is fixed.

By running failed specs first, the issues can be surfaced earlier and reduce
that 20 minute wait to potentially a few minutes. **Considering that a test
suite has multiple spec files, this orchestration strategy will always save
time.**

### Activate Spec Prioritization in Cypress Cloud

:::tip

**Spec Prioritization** is a _Smart Orchestration_ feature available to users
with a
[Business or Enterprise tier Cypress Cloud plan](https://cypress.io/pricing).
Wondering if upgrading your Team tier subscription is worth it? Check out the
[recommendations](/cloud/features/recorded-runs#Recommendations) on the run
overview page to see how much time we predict these features would save you.

:::

Spec Prioritization is a _Smart Orchestration_ feature that is managed within a
project's settings.

**To enable or disable this feature at the Project level (must be an admin user):**

1. Select the desired project within Projects view to visit Cypress Cloud.
2. Click "Project Settings" with the right-hand sidebar.
3. Scroll to the Smart Orchestration section within Project Settings page.
4. Toggle "Spec Prioritization".

<strong>CI Tip: Reduce Costs</strong>

Note that Spec Prioritization **alone** will not save time as it purely alters
the order in which specs are run. However, when used in tandem with
[Auto Cancellation](/cloud/features/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation) it can
result in shorter test runs due to cancellation being triggered earlier, leading
to significantly reduced CI costs.
