## Enable the Microsoft Teams integration

:::caution

<strong>Ownership Requirements</strong>

In order to enable the Cypress integration for Microsoft Teams, you must be an
admin or owner of both your Cypress Cloud organization and your Microsoft Teams
workspace.

:::

### Per-organization configuration (all projects)

1. Go to Cypress Cloud
   [Organizations page](https://cloud.cypress.io/organizations) or open the
   organization switcher.
2. Select the organization you wish to integrate with Microsoft Teams.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/cloud/organizations/select-cypress-organization.jpg"
     alt="Select an organization"
     width={500}
   />

3. Visit the selected organization's **Integrations** page via the side
   navigation.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/cloud/organizations/navigate-to-organization-integrations.jpg"
     alt="Install Cypress Microsoft Teams from Integrations"
     width={500}
   />

4. Click the **Enable** button in the Microsoft Teams section.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/cloud/integrations/teams/enable-teams-integration.jpg"
     alt="Click enable under Microsoft Teams Integration"
     width={1000}
   />

5. You'll navigate to a window that manages webhooks as a way for Cypress Cloud
   to communicate with Microsoft Teams. First, you must configure an _Incoming
   Webhook_ to a Teams channel.

   In Microsoft Teams:

   - Open the channel in which you want to add the webhook and select **•••**
     from the upper-right corner.

   - Select Connectors from the dropdown menu.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/cloud/integrations/teams/teams-connectors.png"
       alt="Visit project settings"
       width={300}
     />

   - Search for Incoming Webhook and select Configure. Provide a name, and
     upload an image for your webhook if necessary.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/cloud/integrations/teams/teams-configure.png"
       alt="Visit project settings"
       width={500}
     />

   - Copy and save the unique webhook URL present in the dialog. The URL maps to
     the channel and you can use it to send information to Teams.

   - Select **Done**.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/cloud/integrations/teams/teams-url.png"
       alt="Visit project settings"
       width={500}
     />

     The webhook is now available in the Teams channel. For more information,
     see
     [Microsoft Teams - Create Incoming Webhooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet#create-incoming-webhooks-1).

6. Then, add the Teams webhook to your Cypress Cloud Organization.

   In Cypress Cloud:

   - Paste in the Teams webhook URL, choosing the types of notifications your
     team should receive.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/cloud/integrations/teams/add-teams-webhook.jpg"
       alt="Click enable under Microsoft Teams Integration"
       width={450}
     />

   Once you've configured and added your webhooks, the installation is complete!
   Cypress Cloud will post run results for **all** projects in your organization
   to the specified Microsoft Teams channel.

#### Remove a webhook

You can have Cypress Cloud stop posting notifications to a channel. You cannot
delete the global notification channels from a project.

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page for the project with the installed
   integration.
2. Scroll down to the **Microsoft Teams** section.
3. Under **Actions**, select **Delete** for each webhook you want deleted.

### Per-project configuration

If your organization has multiple teams working on separate projects, you can
tailor the Microsoft Teams notifications of each project to match your teams'
needs. You can have Cypress Cloud post run results for a specific project.

1. Select your organization in the organization switcher.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/cloud/organizations/select-cypress-organization.jpg"
     alt="Select an organization"
     width={500}
   />
2. Select the project you wish to integrate with Microsoft Teams.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/cloud/projects/select-cypress-project.jpg"
     alt="Select a project"
     width={600}
   />
3. Go to the project's settings page.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/cloud/projects/select-project-settings.jpg"
     alt="Visit project settings"
     width={400}
   />
4. Scroll down and click **Add Teams webhook** in the **Microsoft Teams**
   section.
5. You'll navigate to a window that manages webhooks as a way for Cypress Cloud
   to communicate with Microsoft Teams. First, you must configure an _Incoming
   Webhook_ to a Teams channel.

   In Microsoft Teams:

   - Open the channel in which you want to add the webhook and select **•••**
     from the upper-right corner.

   - Select Connectors from the dropdown menu.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/cloud/integrations/teams/teams-connectors.png"
       alt="Open channel menu menu and select Connectors"
       width={300}
     />

   - Search for Incoming Webhook and select Configure. Provide a name, and
     upload an image for your webhook if necessary.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/cloud/integrations/teams/teams-configure.png"
       alt="Click Configure Incoming Webhook"
       width={500}
     />

   - Copy and save the unique webhook URL present in the dialog. The URL maps to
     the channel and you can use it to send information to Teams.

   - Select **Done**.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/cloud/integrations/teams/teams-url.png"
       alt="Copy url and Click Done"
       width={500}
     />

     The webhook is now available in the Teams channel. For more information,
     see
     [Microsoft Teams - Create Incoming Webhooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet#create-incoming-webhooks-1).

6. Then, add the Teams webhook to your Cypress Cloud Project.

   In Cypress Cloud:

   - Paste in the Teams webhook URL, choosing the types of notifications your
     team should receive.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/cloud/integrations/teams/add-teams-webhook.jpg"
       alt="Paste in the Teams webhook URL"
       width={450}
     />

   Once you've configured and added your webhooks, the installation is complete!
   Cypress Cloud will post run results for **this** project to the specified
   Microsoft Teams channel.

## Notification preferences

By default, Cypress Cloud will post a Teams message to each configured channel
only for failing runs. However, you can select any combination of the followings preferences:

- **Failed runs**: will notify on runs with a _failed_ status.
- **Passed runs**: will notify on runs with a _passed_ status.
- **Flaky tests**: will notify on runs that have an identified _flaky_ test.

To set notification preferences:

1. Navigate to Teams configuration page
2. Select the notification preferences for each channel

#### Filter notifications by tag or run group

When configuring at the project-level, you can filter notifications posted to Teams based on a
[tag](/app/references/command-line#cypress-run-tag-lt-tag-gt) or
[group](/app/references/command-line#cypress-run-group-lt-name-gt) the run was
recorded with. This can be helpful to only post notifications on certain runs,
like those to a staging or release environment.

1. Navigate to the **Teams** configuration page
2. Under **Tags**, select the **Tag** dropdown for the desired integration and
   select which tag(s) to filter. If more than one tag is selected the Teams message will be sent
   if any of the tags were associated with the run.
3. Under **Run Groups**, select the **Run Group** dropdown for the desired integration and
   select which run group(s) to filter. If more than one run group is selected the Teams message will be
   sent if any of the run groups were associated with the run.

If both a tag and run group are selected, only a run associated with both criteria will
trigger a message to be sent to Teams.

### Mute a channel

If you want Cypress Cloud to temporarily stop posting Teams messages to a
certain channel, you can **Mute** that channel. This allows you to easily pause
and resume notifications for a specific channel without losing the configuration
you've put in place.

1. Navigate to the **Teams** configuration page
2. Toggle the **Active** selector for each Teams channel you want muted.
