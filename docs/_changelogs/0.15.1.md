## 0.15.1

_Released 04/01/2016_

**Features:**

- [`cy.go()`](/api/commands/go) and [`cy.reload()`](/api/commands/reload) now
  accept a timeout option. Also, these commands would previously time out after
  the default `commandTimeout` of `4000ms`, but now they will timeout after
  `pageLoadTimeout` of `30000ms`.

**Bugfixes:**

- When an integration test file is unable to run and the `integrationFolder` is
  not the default path, the UI error now properly prints the integration test
  file's path by stripping off `integration` in the path. Fixes
  [#117](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/117).
- `Cypress.Dom.isHidden()` will now throw error when it isn't passed a DOM
  element.

**Misc:**

- Renamed [configuration](/guides/references/configuration) option
  `visitTimeout` to `pageLoadTimeout`. You don't need to change anything. If you
  were specifically setting `visitTimeout` in your `cypress.json` file it will
  be transparently rewritten `pageLoadTimeout` on the next server boot. This
  option was renamed because now multiple commands `cy.visit()`, `cy.go()`, and
  `cy.reload()` all depend on this timeout option.
- The Cypress tray icon has been updated. It's much better now.
