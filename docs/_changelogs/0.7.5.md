## 0.7.5

_Released 06/19/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- [`.click()`](/api/commands/click) now takes into account being covered by a
  fixed positioned element and will increase the window's scroll offset to
  account for this. There are still more improvements to be made before this is
  bulletproof though.
- [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) could potentially resolve to a null
  subject if the matching content was split across multiple nested children
  elements. This has been fixed and contains will now return the first, deepest
  element which contains text potentially spread over multiple text nodes and/or
  children elements.
