## 7.6.0

_Released 06/23/2021_

**Features:**

- You can now override the default delay between typing characters for `.type()`
  with [`Cypress.Keyboard.defaults()`](https://on.cypress.io/keyboard-api) or
  via
  [test configuration](https://on.cypress.io/writing-and-organizing-tests#Allowed-config-values).
  Addresses [#566](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/566).
- The experience when opening a new project via `cypress open` has been
  improved. Addressed in
  [#15826](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15826).
  - The scaffolded example files have been updated to include examples tests of
    the TodoMVC project.
  - You can now easily delete all of the scaffolded example files directly from
    the Test Runner GUI.
  - There's now a button to create a new spec file when no spec files are found
    in the project.
  - A new onboarding banner with be present with helpful links for new users and
    new projects.
- The incoming request object yielded to request handler functions passed to
  `cy.intercept()` (`req`) now has a `req.query` property, which is a
  getter/setter for the query parameters on the request URL. Addresses
  [#16327](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16327).
- You can now pass an `ArrayBuffer` as a request / response body with
  `cy.intercept()`. Addresses
  [#16722](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16722)

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress no longer hangs intermittently when using webpack 5. Fixes
  [#15447](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15447).
- It is no longer necessary to return the config from the plugins function when
  using the `dev-server:start` event for component testing. Fixes
  [#16860](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16860).
- `cy.intercept()` now correctly sets the response body as a string instead of
  an ArrayBuffer when it contains multi-byte characters. Fixes
  [#16292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16292).
- `cy.intercept()` won't corrupt certain binary responses. Fixes
  [#16722](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16722).
- On Windows, the Cypress executable is now code signed by "Cypress.io, Inc.".
  This fixes `spawn UNKNOWN` errors when launching Cypress with code signing
  required by policy on Windows. Fixes
  [#2543](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2543)
- We now warn on `EPERM` errors when accessing the project directory instead of
  erroring. Fixes [#16933](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16933).
- Cypress now better handles running when browsers with unconventional versions
  are present on the machine. Fixes
  [#15485](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15485).
- Expanded the types for `CyHttpMessages.BaseMessage.headers` to support the
  value being an array of strings. Fixes
  [#16734](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16734).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Added `enquirer` dependency. Fixes
  [#16846](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16846).
