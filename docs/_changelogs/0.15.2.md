## 0.15.2

_Released 04/03/2016_

**Features:**

- The
  [error message when Cypress detects that a test has ended early](/guides/references/error-messages)
  (there are still commands left in the queue) now displays a list of these
  commands with a much improved explanation.
- There is now a new [configuration option](/guides/references/configuration):
  `watchForFileChanges` that, when set to `false` in the `cypress.json`, will
  prevent Cypress from attempting to watch for file changes and restart your
  tests.
- You can now set the default [`reporter`](/guides/references/configuration) in
  `cypress.json` for use during `cypress run` or in CI.

**Bugfixes:**

- The [--reporter](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) CLI option is now
  working again.
- the `teamcity` reporter is now also working again.

**Misc:**

- Updated favicon + logo mark
