## 0.17.4

_Released 09/12/2016_

**Breaking Changes:**

- Using subsequent [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit)'s _in the same test_ will
  not necessarily force a full page refresh. If all that changed was the hash of
  a url, then the hash changes will take affect **without** a full page refresh.
  This matches the behavior of a real browser. Previously
  [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) always forced a full page refresh and this
  was not correct.

**Features:**

- Using [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) now acts _exactly_ how modifying the
  URL in a real browser works. This means that if you visit a url with a hash in
  it, instead of forcing a full page refresh, it will now modify the hash route
  as if you had manually changed it. This more accurately reflects real user
  behavior. Previously this was impossible to do with Cypress other than
  manually altering `window.location.hash`.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in `0.17.2` which caused **separate** tests that were
  visiting the same URL not to actually visit the new URL and eventually time
  out. We've updated some of our internal QA processes around this because we
  rarely have regressions and they are a pretty big deal. Fixes
  [#225](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/225).
- Fixed displaying `(null)` contentType when a
  [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) returned a `404` status code. We now only
  display `contentType` when one exists.
