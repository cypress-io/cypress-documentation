## 5.0.0

_Released 8/19/2020_

**Summary:**

Cypress now includes support for test retries! Similar to how Cypress will retry
assertions when they fail, test retries will allow you to automatically retry a
failed test prior to marking it as failed. Read our new guide on
[Test Retries](/guides/guides/test-retries) for more details.

**Breaking Changes:**

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> Please read our
[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes
in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 5.0.**

- The
  [`cypress-plugin-retries`](https://github.com/Bkucera/cypress-plugin-retries)
  plugin has been deprecated in favor of
  [test retries](/guides/guides/test-retries) built into Cypress. Addresses
  [#1313](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1313).
- The [Cypress.Cookies.defaults()](/api/cypress-api/cookies) `whitelist` option
  has been renamed to `preserve` to more closely reflect its behavior. Addressed
  in [#7782](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7782).
- The `blacklistHosts` configuration has been renamed to
  [blockHosts](/guides/references/configuration#Notes) to more closely reflect
  its behavior. Addressed in
  [#7622](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7622).
- The [cy.server()](/api/commands/server) `whitelist` option has been renamed to
  `ignore` to more closely reflect its behavior. Addresses
  [#6642](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6642).
- `libgbm-dev` is now a requirement to run Cypress on Linux. Addressed in
  [#7791](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7791).
- Values yielded by [cy.setCookie()](/api/commands/setcookie),
  [cy.getCookie()](/api/commands/getcookie), and
  [cy.getCookies()](/api/commands/getcookies) will now contain the `sameSite`
  property if specified. Addresses
  [#6892](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6892).
- The `experimentalGetCookiesSameSite` configuration flag has been removed,
  since this behavior is now the default. Addresses
  [#6892](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6892).
- The return type of the [Cypress.Blob](/api/utilities/blob) methods
  `arrayBufferToBlob`, `base64StringToBlob`, `binaryStringToBlob`, and
  `dataURLToBlob` have changed from `Promise<Blob>` to `Blob`. Addresses
  [#6001](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6001).
- Cypress no longer supports file paths with a question mark `?` or exclamation
  mark `!` in them. We now use the
  [webpack preprocessor](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/master/npm/webpack-preprocessor)
  by default and it does not support files with question marks or exclamation
  marks. Addressed in [#7982](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7982).
- For TypeScript compilation of spec, support, and plugins files, the
  `esModuleInterop` option is no longer coerced to `true`. If you need to
  utilize `esModuleInterop`, set it in your `tsconfig.json`. Addresses
  [#7575](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7575).
- Cypress now requires TypeScript 3.4+. Addressed in
  [#7856](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7856).
- Installing Cypress on your system now requires Node.js 10+. Addresses
  [#6574](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6574).
- In spec files, the values for the globals `__dirname` and `__filename` no
  longer include leading slashes. Addressed in
  [#7982](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7982).

**Features:**

- There's a new `retries` configuration option to configure the number of times
  to retry a failing test. Addresses
  [#1313](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1313).
- [.click()](/api/commands/click), [.dblclick()](/api/commands/dblclick), and
  [.rightclick()](/api/commands/rightclick) now accept options `altKey`,
  `ctrlKey`, `metaKey`, and `shiftKey` to hold down key combinations while
  clicking. Addresses [#486](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/486).
- You can now chain `.snapshot()` off of `cy.stub()` and `cy.spy()` to disabled
  snapshots during those commands. For example: `cy.stub().snapshot(false)`.
  Addresses [#3849](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3849).

**Bugfixes:**

- The error `Cannot set property 'err' of undefined` will no longer incorrectly
  throw when rerunning tests in the Test Runner. Fixes
  [#7874](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7874) and
  [#8193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8193).
- Cypress will no longer throw a
  `Cannot read property 'isAttached' of undefined` error during `cypress run` on
  Firefox versions >= 75. Fixes
  [#6813](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/6813).
- The error `Maximum call stack size exceeded` will no longer throw when calling
  `scrollIntoView` on an element in the shadow dom. Fixes
  [#7986](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7986).
- Cypress [environment variables](/guides/guides/environment-variables) that
  accept arrays as their value will now properly evaluate as arrays. Fixes
  [#6810](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6810).
- Elements having `display: inline` will no longer be considered hidden if it
  has child elements within it that are visible. Fixes
  [#6183](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6183).
- When [experimentalShadowDomSupport](/guides/references/experiments) is
  enabled, [.parent()](/api/commands/parent) and
  [.parentsUntil()](/api/commands/parentsuntil) commands now work correctly in
  shadow dom as well as passing a selector to
  [.parents()](/api/commands/parents) when the subject is in the shadow dom.
  Fixed in [#8202](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/8202).
- Screenshots will now be correctly taken when a test fails in an `afterEach` or
  `beforeEach` hook after the hook has already passed. Fixes
  [#3744](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3744).
- Cypress will no longer report screenshots overwritten in a `cy.screenshot()`
  [onAfterScreenshot](/api/commands/screenshot#Get-screenshot-info-from-the-onAfterScreenshot-callback)
  option as a unique screenshot. Fixes
  [#8079](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8079).

  for the filesystem to accept. Fixes
  [#2403](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2403).
- The "last used browser" will now be correctly remembered during `cypress open`
  if a non-default-channel browser was selected. Fixes
  [#8281](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8281).
- For TypeScript projects, `tsconfig.json` will now be loaded and used to
  configure TypeScript compilation of spec and support files. Fixes
  [#7006](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7006) and
  [#7503](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7503).
- `reporterStats` now correctly show the number of passed and failed tests when
  a test passes but the `afterEach` fails. Fixes
  [#7730](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7730).
- The Developer Tools menu will now always display in Electron when switching
  focus from Specs to the Test Runner. Fixes
  [#3559](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3559).
