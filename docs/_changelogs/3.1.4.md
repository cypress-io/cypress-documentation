## 3.1.4

_Released 12/25/2018_

Merry Christmas everyone!

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a very longstanding (!) issue where [.click()](/api/commands/click)
  would fail to click the center coordinates of elements with style
  `display: inline`. Cypress would instead report that the element was being
  covered causing the error:
  `cy.click() failed because this element is being covered by another element`.
  Fixes [#210](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/210).
- We now no longer abort XHR's which have their `.abort()` method called but are
  already complete. This fixes an edge case where complete XHR's were having
  their `disposer` function called in frameworks like `rxJS` which lead to
  Cypress accidentally re-aborting the XHR's after they were complete. Fixes
  [#761](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/761).
- Fixed issues involving XHRs displaying as 'aborted' in the Cypress Command Log
  when they were not actually aborted. Fixes
  [#1652](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1652).
- We no longer abort XHR request during the page's `unload` event and allow the
  browser to handle natively calling abort. Fixes
  [#2968](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2968).
- Fixed an issue where Cypress's `devDependencies` were being included in the
  Windows binary. Fixes
  [#2896](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2896).
- Fixed issue where XHR's `onreadystatechange` was not receiving the proper
  event arguments. Fixes
  [#2925](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2925).
- We now properly strip leading paths of files on uncaught errors from Windows
  OS. Fixes [#2936](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2936).

**Misc:**

- Removed the word 'already' from the Cypress install message in order to be
  less confusing. Adresses
  [#2754](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2754).
- Fixed incomplete type definitions for [cy.request](/api/commands/request).
  Fixes [#2305](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2305).
