## 3.1.5

_Released 1/30/2019_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed issue where the `onLoad` event was never being called when calling
  [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) on the url Cypress is currently navigated
  to. Fixes [#1311](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1311).
- Fixed regression introduced in `3.1.4` that caused an `InvalidStateError` when
  visiting a page with an XHR request with a `responseType` other than `text` or
  `''`. Fixes [#3008](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3008).
- Fixed several issues in Chrome\* versions >= 72 in the Cypress proxy that
  caused using `cy.visit()` with `localhost` to fail, or using `localhost`
  inside of the `baseUrl` configuration option. Fixes
  [#1872](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1872) and
  [#3252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3252) and
  [#1777](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1777).
- Fixed another issue in Chrome\* versions >= 72 where a scrollable command log
  would cause the entire application to be scrollable. Fixes
  [#3253](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3253).
- Fixed not correctly passing the `timeout` option for
  [cy.request()](/api/commands/request). This should fix some instances where
  large `timeout` values would cause `ESOCKETTIMEDOUT` errors. Fixes
  [#2669](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2669).
- Fixed issue where Cypress would inject a script tag before the `<!DOCTYPE>`
  declaration when the document only contained the doctype declaration. Fixes
  [#2617](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2617).
- The error message when visiting a site with an invalid content-type now prints
  the correct content-type of the response Cypress received from the web server.
  Fixes [#3101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3101).
- Fixed issue where an internal `layout.html` file would inadvertently get
  loaded instead of the spec file. Fixes
  [#2891](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2891).
- Fixed issue where the Chromium browser was not detected in Linux due to
  Cypress not distinguishing between Chrome and Chromium browsers with the same
  version. Fixes [#1400](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1400).
- Fixed issue of Cypress being unable to play videos with `autoplay`. We now
  pass the `--no-user-gesture-required` command line switch to Chrome. Fixes
  [#2376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2376).
- We now pass the Chromium command line switches
  `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream` and `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream` to
  Chrome by default in order to better support testing webcam functionality.
  Fixes [#2704](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2704).
- Updated filenames allowed for screenshots to allow more characters that are
  valid. Fixes [#3052](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3052).
- Fixed TypeScript error caused by `dtslint` dependency introduced in 3.1.4.
  Fixes [#3024](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3024) and
  [#3136](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3136).
- Improved error message displayed for `cypress cache` to not display
  `[object Object]` and made `--help` labels more descriptive. Fixes
  [#2589](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2589).
- Using [.clear()](/api/commands/clear) on inputs of type 'date' is now working.
  Fixes [#2738](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2738)
- Fixed issue where `event` was undefined when using an `onload` event handler.
  Fixed [#2859](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2859)
