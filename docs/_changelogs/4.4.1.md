## 4.4.1

_Released 4/20/2020_

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress can now launch on systems where Chromium is installed via Snapcraft.
  Fixes [#7020](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7020).
- We now check whether the `mouseup` event's target element is detached before
  issuing the `click` event during [.click()](/api/commands/click). Fixes
  [#6923](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6923).
- We fixed a regression in [3.8.1](#3-8-1) where the Test Runner could send an
  `undefined` organization ID during project setup when the default organization
  is preselected. Fixes
  [#7013](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7013).
- We fixed a regression in [4.4.0](#4-4-0) that caused projects to include
  bundled TypeScript. Fixes
  [#7036](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7036).
- Fixed an issue where sites that set `Feature-Policy: document-domain 'none'`
  headers would fail to load in Cypress. Fixes
  [#6480](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6480).

**Misc:**

- We fixed some extra spacing displaying below the project nav in the Test
  Runner. Addresses [#7023](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7023)
- The typings for run results when using the
  [Module API](/guides/guides/module-api) now indicate they can be `null` or
  `undefined`. Addresses
  [#6126](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6126).
- We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript
  to JavaScript. Addresses
