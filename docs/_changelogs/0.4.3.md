## 0.4.3

_Released 04/09/2015_

**Features:**

- Added functionality which enables [`cy.server()`](/api/commands/server) and
  [`cy.route()`](/api/commands/route) to be created prior to
  [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit). The server and routes will apply to the
  next page which is visited. This allows you to stub requests which happen on
  page load. Suggested in
  [#17](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17).
- [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) now takes an optional `onBeforeLoad`
  callback option which is invoked when your page begins to ender but prior to
  its load event.

**Misc:**

- Improved error message when attempting to use `cy.agents` or anything else
  which requires a remote sandbox. Fixes
  [#12](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/12).
