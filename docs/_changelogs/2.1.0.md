## 2.1.0

_Released 3/1/2018_

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent a bug with `node-sass` on OSX + Windows when local `node` version does
  not match bundled `node` when importing components directly in spec files. The
  underlying issue was because we forgot to update `Buildkite` and `Appveyor`
  when we upgraded `Electron` in `2.0.0`. Fixes
  [#1387](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1387) and
  [#1390](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1390).

**Features:**

- The
  [Selector Playground](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Selector-Playground)
  has been updated to automatically prefer `data-cy`, `data-test` or
  `data-testid` attributes when providing the unique selector for an element.
  Additionally it now exposes a
  [public API](/api/cypress-api/selector-playground-api) that you can use to
  control how it determines which selector to use. Fixes
  [#1135](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1135).
