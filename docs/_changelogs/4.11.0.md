## 4.11.0

_Released 7/21/2020_

**Features:**

- You can now pass an `ensureScrollability: false` option to
  [.scrollTo()](/api/commands/scrollto) to skip checking whether the element is
  scrollable. Addresses
  [#1924](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1924).
- [cy.clock()](/api/commands/clock) now accepts Dates as well as a Number for
  now. Fixes [#7786](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7786).
- The [Module API](/guides/guides/module-api) has a new
  `cypress.cli.parseRunArguments` function to assist in parsing user-supplied
  command line arguments using the same logic as `cypress run` uses. Addesses
  [#7760](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7760).

**Bugfixes:**

- Running multiple specs within Firefox during `cypress run` on Windows will no
  longer fail trying to make a connection to the browser. Fixes
  [#6392](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6392).
- Cypress will no longer throw a
  `Cannot read property 'isAttached' of undefined` error during `cypress run` on
  Firefox versions >= 75. Fixes
  [#6813](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6813).
- Fixed an issue where Cypress tests in Chromium-family browsers could randomly
  fail with the error "WebSocket is already in CLOSING or CLOSED state." Fixes
  [#7180](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7180).
- Taking a screenshot of an element that changes height upon scroll will no
  longer throw an `invalid for option "size"` error. Fixes
  [#6099](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6099).
- Setting `viewportHeight` or `viewportWidth` from within the
  [test configuration](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#test-configuration)
  now properly changes the viewport size for the duration of the suite or test.
- Setting deep objects and arrays on `config` within the `pluginsFile` now sets
  the values correctly. Fixes
  [#7959](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7959).
- The progress bar for `cy.wait()` now reflects the correct `requestTimeout` and
  `responseTimeout` of the command. Fixes
  [#7881](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7881).
- The command's progress bar will not longer restart when its parent test is
  collapsed in the Command Log. Fixes
  [#7912](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7912).
- Key value pairs sent to `ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS` as `key=value` will now
  be properly read in. Fixes
  [#7994](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7994).
- Stubbed responses responding with an empty string to
  [cy.route()](/api/commands/route) now correctly display as 'xhr stub' in the
  Test Runner's Command Log. Fixes
  [#8018](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8018).
- Quickly reclicking the "Run All Tests" button in the Test Runners' Command Log
  will no longer throw errors about undefined properties and the tests will no
  longer hang. Fixes [#7968](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7968).

**Misc:**

- The error messages thrown from `pluginsFile` and `supportFile` now mention
  that `.ts` extensions are supported. Addresses
  [#7940](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7940).
- The style when focusing on tests in the Command Log has been updated.
  Addresses [#7855](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7855).
