## 1.3.0

_Released 12/17/2017_

**Features:**

- Plugins now emit a
  [before:browser:launch](/guides/tooling/plugins-guide#Browser-Launching) event
  exposing you the browser that will be launched and its launch arguments. This
  enables you to modify the arguments prior to launching the browser. You can
  also use these arguments to modify how Chrome runs and to also test Chrome
  extensions. Fixes [#691](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/691) and
  [#298](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/298).
- We have launched a "CSS Selector Playground", a new UI button in the Test
  Runner that enables you to highlight elements in your application and receive
  a unique selector. You can also find elements by their text content. These
  mimics [cy.get()](/api/commands/get) and
  [cy.contains()](/api/commands/contains) behavior. Additionally you can copy
  the generated Cypress command to your clipboard or output the generated
  selector to your console. This feature is in beta. It only works in Chrome
  (not in Electron). We are aware of some bugs in it, but it is good enough for
  use and feedback. Please check out issue
  [#917](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/917), watch an animated
  gif demonstration, and leave any feedback you have there. Fixes
  [#917](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/917).
