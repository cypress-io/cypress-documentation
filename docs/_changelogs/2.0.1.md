## 2.0.1

_Released 2/16/2018_

**Bugfixes:**

- Using [cy.contains()](/api/commands/contains) with a RegExp argument is now
  properly escaped. Fixes
  [#1322](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1322).
- Fixed a runaway RegExp causing large `.js` files to take dozens of seconds to
  process. This was a regression caused by `2.0.0` with the new
  [modifyObstructiveCode](/guides/references/configuration#Browser) option.
  We've optimized the RegExp and the performance is back to being almost
  identical to transparently passing responses through. Fixes
  [#1330](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1330).
