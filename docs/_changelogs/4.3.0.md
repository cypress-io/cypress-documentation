## 4.3.0

_Released 3/30/2020_

**Features:**

- [Errors shown in the Test Runner](/guides/guides/debugging#Errors) have a new
  design including an expandable stack trace, better highlighting of code
  elements, and 'Learn more' links that link to relevant Cypress documentation.
  This is part of our larger improvements to error display with more exciting
  features to come. Addresses
  [#3762](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3762).
- When you open a Cypress project, clicking on the **Settings** tab and clicking
  into the **Experiments** panel will display the
  [experimental features](/guides/references/configuration#Experiments) that are
  available and whether they are enabled for your project.
- Added support for setting cookie `sameSite` values via `cy.setCookie()`.
  Addresses [#2437](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2437).
- Added experimental support for adding `sameSite` values to the objects yielded
  from [cy.setCookie()](/api/commands/setcookie),
  [cy.getCookie()](/api/commands/getcookie), and
  [cy.getCookies()](/api/commands/getcookies). Users can enable this by setting
  the
  [experimentalGetCookiesSameSite](/guides/references/configuration#Experiments)
  configuration value to `true`. In Cypress 5, this will be the default.
  Addresses [#2437](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2437).
- Added support for the `SameSite` cookie attribute in `cy.request()`,
  `cy.visit()`, and proxied HTTP requests. Addresses
  [#6757](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6757).
- When an assertion is retried (using [.should()](/api/commands/should)) and
  fails, it now shows the diff in the `stdout`. Addresses
  [#6722](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6722).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in [4.2.0](#4-2-0) where cypress installation could fail if
  Git is not installed. Fixes
  [#6752](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6752).
- Fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where certain HTTP requests could fail
  with `Parse Error: Invalid header value char` or
  `Parse Error: Header overflow`. Fixes
  [#5602](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5602).
- Fixed a regression in [4.2.0](#4-2-0) where Electron deprecation warnings were
  printed to stderr in open mode. Fixes
  [#6750](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6750).
- Cookies set with a Domain containing an unknown TLD are now sent along for all
  requests. For example, a cookie like `foo=bar; Domain=.cypress.test` will now
  be sent during [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) to
  `http://local.cypress.test`. Fixes
  [#6628](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6628).
- We fixed a situation where a cross-origin errors could incorrectly throw in
  Chrome. Fixes [#5270](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5270).
- Visibility checks against `vue-fragment` elements no longer throw an
  unexpected error. Fixes
  [#6745](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6745).
- The stack trace is now properly shown in the console when clicking the command
  for tests having an `.only` that throw an error. Fixes
  [#6744](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6744).
- `firefoxGcInterval` can now correctly be set to `null`. Fixes
  [#6825](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6825).
- Cypress will no longer crash the process if an empty video chunk is received.
  Addressed in [#6818](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/6818).
- Assertions failures on DOM elements no longer show unexpected diffs when they
  weren't retried. Fixes
  [#6723](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6723).

**Misc:**

- Security warnings no longer show in Mac OS when opening Cypress since our
  application now undergoes notarization from Apple. Addresses
  [#5791](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5791).

  for projects without an ID.Addresses

  Cypress Dashboard. Addresses
  [#6808](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6808).

  [cypress-io/netlify-plugin-cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/netlify-plugin-cypress))
  to send along to the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses
  [#6780](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6780).
