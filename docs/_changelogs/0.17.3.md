## 0.17.3

_Released 09/11/2016_

**Features:**

- When `visible` assertions such as `should('be.visible')` fail we now print the
  reason Cypress thought the element was invisible. Matches what Cypress prints
  out when attempting to interact with invisible elements. Fixes
  [#221](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/221).

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent `Host` header from having its port appended when request was for port
  `80` or `443` which lead to 3rd party reverse proxy problems such as with
  `zeit.co` hosting. Fixes
  [#222](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/222).
- Send valid http response errors, and display new lines correctly. Fixes
  [#218](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/218).
- Correctly inject on `5xx` http response codes. Fixes
  [#217](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/217).
- Correctly inject on `4xx` and other bad http response codes when using Cypress
  as the file server. Fixes
  [#219](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/219).
- Correctly inject on `gzip` errors from 3rd party servers doing unintended
  things. Fixes [#220](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/220).
