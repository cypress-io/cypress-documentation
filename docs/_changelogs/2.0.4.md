## 2.0.4

_Released 2/25/2018_

**Bugfixes:**

- The `cypress` npm package now has the correct `engines` set in `package.json`.
  This was accidentally getting overwritten and caused errors when
  `engineStrict` was set in environments using `node` older than `8.2.1`. Fixes
  [#1373](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1373).
