## 4.5.0

_Released 4/28/2020_

**Features:**

- Cypress now supports the execution of component tests using framework-specific
  adaptors when setting the `experimentalComponentTesting` configuration option
  to `true`. For more details see the
  [@cypress/react](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/master/npm/react)
  and [@cypress/vue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/master/npm/vue)
  repos. Addresses [#5922](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5922)
  and [#6968](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6968).

**Bugfixes:**

- [Custom Mocha reporters](/guides/tooling/reporters) will now correctly use the
  version of Mocha bundled with Cypress. Fixes
  [#3537](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3537) and
  [#6984](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6984).
- We better account for word boundaries in application scripts when
  `modifyObstructiveCode` is `true`. Fixes
  [#7138](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7138).
- Fixed an issue where iterators in TypeScript were not properly transpiled.
  Fixes [#7098](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7098).

**Misc:**

- The update window in the Test Runner now encourages yarn users to
  `yarn upgrade` Cypress instead of `yarn add` to help prevent installing 2
  versions of Cypress when using yarn workspaces. Addressed in
  [#7101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7101).
- We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript
  to JavaScript. Addresses
  [#2690](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2690) in
  [#7031](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7031) and
  [#7097](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7097).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` from `8.2.0` to `8.2.3`. Addressed in
  [#7079](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7079).
