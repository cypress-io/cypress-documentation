## 5.2.0

_Released 9/15/2020_

**Features:**

- Added the configuration option `includeShadowDom` for enabling shadow DOM
  querying globally, per-suite, per-test, or programmatically. Addresses
  [#8442](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8442).
- Added a `followRedirect` option to request interception with
  [`cy.route2()`](http), allowing redirects to be followed before continuing to
  response interception. Addresses
  [#7967](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7967).
- Added the capability to specify `delayMs` and `throttleKbps` when stubbing
  static responses with [`cy.route2()`](http). Addresses
  [#7661](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7661).
- Installing Cypress pre-releases no longer requires setting the
  `CYPRESS_BINARY_INSTALL` environment variable. Addresses
  [#8482](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8482).

**Performance Improvements:**

- Fixed a performance issue which led to CPU bottlenecking during Cypress runs.
  Addresses [#8012](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8012) and
  [#8297](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8297).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where using TypeScript path aliases in the plugins file would
  error. Addresses [#8555](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8555).
- Fixed an issue where using `cy.contains()` within a shadow root would not
  yield the correct element. Addresses
  [#8494](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8494).
- Fixed an issue where querying the shadow DOM in a `cy.within()` callback would
  throw the error `root.getRootNode is not a function`. Addresses
  [#8478](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8478).
- Fixed an issue with `cy.type()` `{moveToStart}/{moveToEnd}` special characters
  moving the cursor to the current line instead of the entire text editable when
  typing in a `contenteditable` element. Addresses
  [#8465](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8465).
- Fixed an issue where typing into a manually-focused number input would prepend
  the number instead of appending it. Addresses
  [#7170](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7170).
- `cy.type()` now fires a `KeyboardEvent` event instead of an `Event` event.
  Addresses [#6125](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6125) and
  [#5650](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5650).
- Fixed long selectors in the selector playground text input overflowing other
  page elements. Addresses
  [#8247](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8247) and
  [#4184](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4184).
- Fixed an issue where assertions on `cy.getCookie()` would be called twice.
  Addresses [#6672](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6672).
- Fixed an issue that caused the "Open in IDE" button on hooks and tests not to
  appear in Firefox. Addresses
  [#8257](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8257).
- Fixed an issue causing Cypress to hang on test retry in run mode with certain
  assertions. Addresses
  [#8363](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8363).

**Documentation Changes:**

- Fixed examples of delaying and throttling responses with
  [`cy.route2()`](http). Addresses
  [#8489](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8489).
- Added examples of using a response function with [`cy.route2()`](http).
  Addresses [#8468](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8468).
- Removed unmaintained languages. English docs is the only supported language by
  the Cypress team. We greatly appreciate the contributions from the community
  for other languages, but these docs are largely stale, unmaintained, and
  partial. The Cypress team will seek out more scalable docs internalization
  implementation in the future.

**Misc:**

- The `experimentalShadowDomSupport` configuration flag has been removed. It is
  no longer necessary to enable shadow DOM testing.
- Improved the error message when the subject provided to `cy.shadow()` is not a
  shadow host. Addresses
  [#8530](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8530).
- Improved the error message when the Cypress binary is not executable. It now
  recommends trying to clear the cache and re-install. Addresses
  [#8397](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8397).
- Added missing type declarations for the [`cy.route2()`](http) command.
- Updated the type declaration for `Cypress.Commands.add()`, adding `Promise` to
  the list of allowed return types. Addresses
  [#7807](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7807).
