## 1.2.0

_Released 12/14/2017_

**Features:**

- Plugins can now return a `Promise` and modify the yielded `config` to set new
  configuration values and environment variables. Fixes
  [#1042](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1042) and
  [#909](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/909) and
  [#576](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/576).
- There is a new [userAgent](/guides/references/configuration#Browser) option in
  `cypress.json`. This enables you to change the `userAgent` of the browser for
  the entire browsing session. Fixes
  [#364](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/364).
- There is a new [blacklistHosts](/guides/references/configuration#Browser)
  option in `cypress.json` that allows you to block requests made to those
  hosts. Blocked requests will respond with a `503` status code. This is useful
  for blocking 3rd party domains like Google Analytics. We have added a
  [new 'Stubbing Google Analytics' recipe](/examples/examples/recipes#Stubbing-and-spying)
  demonstrating this. Fixes
  [#442](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/442).
- Added chai assertions in TypeScript to generate autocompletion. Fixes
  [#1073](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1073).

**Bugfixes:**

- Updated TypeScript definitions to more accurately match the current Cypress
  API. Fixes [#1050](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1050). Also
  note that if you were extending Cypress in TypeScript the `Chainer` interface
  changed. Please read {% issue '1048#issuecomment-351891910' %} to understand
  what you will need to update.

**Misc:**

- Renamed `environmentVariables` to `env` in the Desktop GUI. Fixes
  [#1052](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1052).
- [Cypress.config()](/guides/references/configuration#Cypress-config) now
  returns a complete set of configuration values. Fixes
  [#509](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/509).
- Added TypeScript typings for bundled Cypress tools like `$`, `_`, etc. Fixes
  [#1046](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1046).
- Some error messages were made more passive. Fixes
  [#1025](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1025).
