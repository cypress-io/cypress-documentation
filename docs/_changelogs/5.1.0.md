## 5.1.0

_Released 9/1/2020_

**Features:**

- Introducing _experimental_ full network stubbing support ðŸŽ‰.
  - With `experimentalNetworkStubbing` enabled, the `cy.route2` command is
    available. Addressed in
    [#4176](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4176).
  - By using [`cy.route2()`](http), your tests can intercept, modify, and wait
    on any type of HTTP request originating from your app, including
    `XMLHttpRequest`s, `fetch` requests, beacons, and subresources (like iframes
    and scripts).
  - Outgoing HTTP requests can be modified before reaching the destination
    server, and the HTTP response can be intercepted as well before it reaches
    the browser.
  - See the [`cy.route2()`](http) docs for more information on how to enable
    this experiment.
- `cy.trigger()` now accepts an `eventConstructor` option for specifying the
  constructor with which to create the event to trigger. Addresses
  [#5650](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5650).
