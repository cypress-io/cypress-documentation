## 0.18.2

_Released 12/15/2016_

**Bugfixes:**

- Under the hood [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) now sets an
  `Accept: text/html,*/*` request header to prevent some web servers from
  sending back `404` in the case where they required this header. Only a small %
  of servers would ever do this, but `webpack-dev-server` was one of them. Fixes
  [#309](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/309).
- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) now sends an `Accept: */*` request
  header by default too. Fixes
  [#338](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/338).

**Misc:**

- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) now includes more debugging
  information (related to headers) in the error output. Fixes
  [#341](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/341).
- When [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) times out, we now output much
  better error messages including information about the request sent. Fixes
  [#340](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/340).
