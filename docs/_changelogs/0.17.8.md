## 0.17.8

_Released 10/13/2016_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed `opener of undefined` errors due to `page load` events causing snapshots
  prior to the `load` event of the remote application. Thanks to everyone who
  helped pitched in on this one! Fixes
  [#258](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/258).
- Cypress now correctly sets cookies with `expirationDate` in the past. Chrome
  did not handle these cookies as documented and our code did not take this into
  account. We also added a lot more `e2e` tests around this behavior. Fixes
  [#266](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/266).
- We are now taking additional precautions to prevent Cypress from trashing the
  wrong folder during an upgrade (with an open project). This was actually fixed
  in `0.17.7` but the problem was is that during an update, the new version
  (which was fixed) was still being passed the wrong arguments from the older
  (broken) application. We've now upgraded `0.17.8` to detect this, and just use
  the expected default install location of Cypress. If you're concerned, just
  _close_ your currently open project before updating. Fixes
  [#265](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/265).

**Misc:**

- When an in app update fails in `linux` we now provide instructions on how to
  manually update Cypress.
- We now properly take the `maxAge` cookie flag into account and give it
  preference over the `expires` flag as per the cookie spec.
