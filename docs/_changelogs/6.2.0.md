## 6.2.0

_Released 12/21/2020_

**Features:**

- You can now listen to `before:run`, `after:run`, `before:spec` and
  `after:spec` events in the plugins file when setting the
  [experimentalRunEvents](/guides/references/experiments) configuration option
  to `true`. See the [`before:run`](/api/plugins/before-run-api),
  [`after:run`](/api/plugins/after-run-api),
  [`before:spec`](/api/plugins/before-spec-api) and
  [`after:spec`](/api/plugins/after-spec-api) docs for more information.
  Addressed in [#9646](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/9646),
  [#14178](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14178)
  [#14238](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14238) and
  [#14263](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14263).
- The `Timed out retrying` error message now displays the amount of time Cypress
  retried. Addresses [#5781](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5781).
- The RouteMatcher argument for [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) has a
  new `matchUrlAgainstPath` property. When set to `true`, Cypress will match the
  supplied `url` against incoming `path`s. Addressed in
  [#14241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14241).

**Bugfixes:**

- Passing a URL as a string or RegExp to
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) will automatically set
  `matchUrlAgainstPath` to `true`. This means that the supplied string or RegExp
  will be matched against the **path** if matching against the **URL** fails.
  Fixes [#9379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9379) and
  [#14256](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14256).
- Getting an alias of [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) using
  [cy.get()](/api/commands/get) will no longer always yield `null`. Fixes
  [#9306](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9306).
- [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) will now automatically responds to
  CORS preflight requests (HTTP `OPTIONS` requests) that match defined routes.
  Fixes [#9599](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9599).
- Response errors from `forceNetworkError` can now be awaited using
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) and [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait).
  Fixes [#9062](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9062).
- Using [cy.log()](/api/commands/log) inside [.then()](/api/commands/then) no
  longer breaks the subject value in the command chain. Fixes
  [#8084](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8084).
- Using
  [Cypress.Commands.overwrite](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#Overwrite-Existing-Commands)
  to overwrite [.then()](/api/commands/then) now preserves the proper `this`
  context and sets aliases correctly. Fixes
  [#5101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5101).
- Using
  [Cypress.Commands.overwrite](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#Overwrite-Existing-Commands)
  to overwrite [cy.route()](/api/commands/route) or
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) and wait on its alias now properly
  works. Fixes [#3890](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3890) and
  [#9580](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9580).
- Cypress no longer fails to find specs if you set the fixtures folder to be the
  same as the integration folder. Fixes
  [#14226](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14226).
- Cypress no longer fails to show error code frames if the spec filename has a
  space in it, fixes [#7553](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7553).

**Misc:**

- `scrollBehavior` is now an allowed type when passed as test configuration.
  Addresses [#9643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9643).
- The `FileObject` type for the file argument of the `file:preprocessor` event
  now includes the `EventEmitter` type. Addresses
  [#9276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9276).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` from `11.0.2` to `11.0.3`. Addressed in
  [#9409](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9409).
