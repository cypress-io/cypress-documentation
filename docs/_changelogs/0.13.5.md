## 0.13.5

_Released 01/03/2016_

**Features:**

- Added new command: [`cy.go()`](/api/commands/go) which accepts `back`,
  `forward`, or an arbitrary Number.
- [`cy.go()`](/api/commands/go) enables you to navigate back or forward in your
  history. Cypress intelligently handles situations where moving forward or back
  causing a full page refresh, and will wait for the new page to load before
  resolving and moving onto new commands. It additionally handles situations
  where a page load was not caused (such as hash routing) and will resolve
  immediately.

**Misc:**

- Using `{force404: false}` will now output a warning explaining this is now the
  default option and can be removed safely.
