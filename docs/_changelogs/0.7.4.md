## 0.7.4

_Released 06/18/2015_

**Misc:**

- Attempting to [`.click()`](/api/commands/click) a select element will now
  throw an error. The error guides you to using the
  [`.select()`](/api/commands/select) command, as that is the command you should
  use to change a `<select>` value.
- [`cy.route()`](/api/commands/route) responses are now validated. If responses
  are `null` or `undefined` Cypress will throw a very specific error message.
- Cypress will now display `cypress.json` parse errors when attempting to boot a
  project when there is a syntax error in `cypress.json`.
