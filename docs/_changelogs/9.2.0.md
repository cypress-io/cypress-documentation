## 9.2.0

_Released 12/20/2021_

**Features:**

- Cypress will throw an error when a user attempts to update a configuration
  value at run-time using either the Test Configuration or using
  `Cypress.config()` that is a
  [readonly option](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Test-Configuration).
  Addresses [#6407](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6407) and
  [#19001](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19001).
- A `timeout` option has been added to the `cy.writeFile()` command, with a
  default value of `defaultCommandTimeout`. Addresses
  [#3350](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3350).
- The default `maxHttpBufferSize` for the internal socket server has been
  increased to
  [Node's maximum Buffer size](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufferconstantsmax_length)
  (size varies by OS) to allow large file writes with `cy.writeFile()`.
  Addresses [#19140](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19140).
- Add `CYPRESS_VERIFY_TIMEOUT` environment variable to override the timeout
  duration of the `verify` command. Addresses
  [#18290](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18290).

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent unnecessary snapshotting when running default assertions that would
  unnecessarily increase CPU use in `cypress open` mode which lead to out of
  memory crashes on certain browsers. Fixes
  [#18549](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18549).
- Removed automatic retries for failed HTTP requests through the proxy. This
  fixes an issue where failed requests could be re-sent too many times in some
  conditions. This change could increase the number of failed requests that your
  app sees. Fixes [#19043](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19043).
- Reduced the occurrence of an issue where logs for `fetch` and `xhr` requests
  could be associated with the wrong request. Fixes
  [#19043](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19043).
- Tests that are skipped within `then` blocks will no longer throw errors
  causing the test to fail. Tests that are skipped outside of `then` blocks will
  no longer trigger the fail event. This will prevent screenshots from happening
  from errors thrown by the fail event. Fixes
  [#14867](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14867) and
  [#17660](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17660).
- Fixed a regression in [9.0.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-0-0) where a
  fixture provided in a static response to `cy.intercept()` did not support
  passing `null` to encoding to read the fixture as a Buffer. This identified an
  undocumented 9.0.0 Breaking Change where the default read behavior of a
  fixture changed from a Buffer to being read with `utf8` encoding. Fixes
  [#19344](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19344).
- Fixed a regression in [9.0.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-0-0) where
  `cy.contains()` attempted to ignore `<script>` and `<style>` elements found
  within `<body>`. by deleting them from the dom. This behavior was corrected to
  ignore the elements without deleting them. Fixes
  [#19377](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19377).
- Cypress will no longer crash when proxying an ill formed request. For example,
  if the application under test has a resource of `"http: //localhost/asset.js"`
  (notice the extraneous space), Cypress will now log a debug message and the
  asset will fail to load. Fixes
  [#9220](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9220).
- Correct `Cypress.Command.add()` and `Cypress.Command.override()` TypeScript
  types. Fixes [#18879](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18879),
  [#19095](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19095) and
  [#18940](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18940).
  - Custom command implementations typings take into account `prevSubject`
    variants.
  - Custom command implementations now allows to NOT return a value.
  - Custom command overwrites typings take into account `originalFn` function.
- Add types for `Cypress.session.clearAllSavedSessions()`. Fixes
  [#19363](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19363).

**Dependencies:**

- Upgraded `ssri` from `6.0.1` to `6.0.2` to mitigate
  [ssri vulnerability](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ssri@6.0.1). Addressed in
  [#19351](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19351).
