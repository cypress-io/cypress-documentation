## 0.18.6

_Released 01/29/2017_

**Features:**

- We now launch Cypress tests directly to the `baseUrl` to avoid an initial page
  refresh when encountering the first [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit)
  command. This should help tests run faster. Fixes
  [#382](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/382).

**Bugfixes:**

- Uninstalling the last used browser no longer causes the Test Runner to error
  and hang. Fixes [#371](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/371).
- Fixed issue where `stdout` would not be displayed on a completed `cypress ci`
  run. Fixes [#398](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/398).
- Fixed a longstanding issue in Cypress where logging in from another computer
  would kill the session on all other computers, and prevent you from accessing
  `cypress get:key` (amongst other things). Fixes
  [#400](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/400).

**Misc:**

- We now validate all of the configuration options set in `cypress.json` to
  ensure it has valid types. Fixes
  [#399](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/399).
- We now validate that `baseUrl` is accessible **prior** to running tests. This
  prevents a common situation where you may forget to boot your web server and
  have instantly failing tests. Fixes
  [#383](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/383).
- We now show the entire scaffolded tree of files when adding a brand new
  project. Fixes [#401](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/401).
- We display errors coming from `babel` with more helpful information now.
- Changed the
  [Test Runner](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/packages/desktop-gui)
  to use `JWT` for authorization. **You will have to log in again**.
