## 3.1.1

_Released 11/2/2018_

**Features:**

- You can now pass a `flag` option to [cy.writeFile()](/api/commands/writefile).
  The [following flags](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system_flags) are
  available. Fixes [#1249](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1249).
- There is a new
  [CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Mirroring)
  environment variable for installing Cypress at a mirror url. Fixes
  [#2609](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/2609).
- The [Module API](/guides/guides/module-api) now returns the `runUrl` from
  `cypress.run()`. Fixes
  [#2596](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2596).
- Specs now properly display as focused when navigating through specs via the
  keyboard. Fixes [#2273](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/2273).
- Tasks registered in the plugins file with the 'task' event are merged with any
  tasks registered by previous calls to `on('task')`, instead of overwriting the
  previous tasks. Fixes
  [#2284](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2284).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a bug where Cypress would error when a secure cookie flag was set and
  then expired from an HTTPS url without the subsequent secure flag. Due to the
  way Cypress was constructing the url, this would fail to actually remove the
  cookie. Fixes [#1264](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1264),
  [#1321](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1321),
  [#1799](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1799).
- We now truncate filenames for screenshots to not exceed 255 characters in
  length. Previously there were cases where the screenshot filename would exceed
  255 characters and error. Fixes
  [#2403](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2403) and
  [#2665](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2665).
- Fixed issue when using [cy.writeFile()](/api/commands/writefile) and passing
  an object to a `.json` file. The object is now correctly written to the JSON
  file instead of a string. Fixes
  [#2373](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/2373).
- We updated how we handle
  [trashAssetsBeforeRuns](/guides/references/configuration#Screenshots)
  behavior. We now trash the contents of the
  [screenshotsFolder](/guides/references/configuration#Folders-Files) and
  [videosFolder](/guides/references/configuration#Folders-Files) directories
  instead of trashing the directories themselves. This helps maintain any file
  access permissions for the directories. Fixes
  [#1943](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1943) and
  [#2600](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2600).
- Fixed bug where mocked Dates using [cy.clock()](/api/commands/clock) would not
  be an instance of `Date`. Fixes
  [#2570](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2570).
- Directories within specs whose names contain `.` are now correctly read as
  directories instead of spec files within the Test Runner. Fixes
  [#2423](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2423).
- Cypress no longer automatically takes screenshots of skipped tests. Fixes
  [#2368](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2368).
- Fixed an issue where returning/resolving `undefined` from a
  [cy.task()](/api/commands/task) handler resulted in an incorrect runtime
  error. Fixes [#2553](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2553).
- Update
  [modifyObstructiveCode](/guides/references/configuration#modifyObstructiveCode)
  to account for framebusting techniques that use `window.frameElement`, so that
  Applications using this technique will run properly in Cypress. Fixes
  [#2582](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2582).
- Fixed bug where only the first DOM element of an array of DOM elements would
  be blacked out after being passed as argument to `blackout` within
  [cy.screenshot()](/api/commands/screenshot). Fixes
  [#2508](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2508).
- We fixed an issue involving timers after running
  [cy.screenshot()](/api/commands/screenshot). Fixes
  [#2432](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2432).
- The Test Runner now retries node-originated errors from our internal API
  requests. Fixes [#2341](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2341)
- Fixed issue with multiple `readyStateChanges` with the same `readyState`.
  Fixes [#1150](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1150).
- Fixed Type error being thrown for users using TypeScript 3. Fixes
  [#2363](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2363).
