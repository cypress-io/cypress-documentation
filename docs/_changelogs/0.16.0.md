## 0.16.0

_Released 05/17/2016_

**Notes:**

- Updating through the Desktop App in **Linux** does not work. To update please
  run [cypress install](/guides/guides/command-line) from the command line.
- We are still updating the docs to reflect all of these changes.
- All users must _LOG IN AGAIN_ and re-add their projects. Sorry, we've changed
  the way we store local data.

**Overview:**

- `0.16.0` marks a significant change for Cypress. Before this we only issued
  commands using regular JavaScript and coordinated these with the back end
  server which is running. As of `0.16.0` we are now tapping into the underlying
  browser automation libraries which enable us to exceed the limitations of the
  JavaScript sandbox. This means we have total control over the browser for more
  powerful automation tooling. The downside is that we have only implemented
  these APIs for Chrome, and therefore running on multiple browsers will no
  longer work. This is a temporary setback as we'll be adding driver support for
  all of the other browsers over a period of time. You can read more about our
  browser management [here](/guides/guides/launching-browsers).

**Breaking Changes:**

- Running tests in Cypress now requires either Chrome, Chromium, or Canary to be
  installed on your OS environment. We intend to expand support for more
  browsers in the future, but for now, only these 3 are supported.
- Removed support for `Cypress.Cookies.get`, `Cypress.Cookies.set` and
  `Cypress.Cookies.remove`.
- Changed return of [`cy.getCookies()`](/api/commands/getcookies) to return an
  array of cookies, each with properties include name, value, etc.
- Changed return of [`cy.clearCookies()`](/api/commands/clearcookies) to return
  null (previously was returning Cookie that was cleared).
- [`Cypress.Cookies.debug()`](/api/cypress-api/cookies#Debug) has been
  temporarily disabled and will be re-enabled later.
- Browsers are spawned in a Cypress specific profile so that we can maintain a
  clean state apart of your regular browsing usage. You will notice that your
  extensions are no longer installed. This is on purpose. 3rd party extensions
  can often get in the way of Cypress and cause failures. However, developer
  specific extensions for Angular, Ember, and React do not cause any issues but
  you'll want to reinstall them. You only have to install them once and they
  will persist.
- The `whitelist` callback function of
  [`Cypress.Cookies.defaults()`](/api/cypress-api/cookies#Defaults) now receives
  a `cookie object` instead of just the `cookies name` as a string.

**Features:**

- When a project is initially run from the desktop app, you can now choose to
  run Cypress in a select number of browsers including: Chrome, Chromium, or
  Canary (depending on what's installed on your OS).
- Browser sessions are spawned independently of your existing profiles and we've
  disabled things like password saving / prompting, JavaScript popup blocking,
  and other features which get in the way of testing. Read more
  [here](/guides/guides/launching-browsers)
- We automatically spawn Chrome in a **custom theme** so you can visually
  distinguish the difference between browser sessions spawned with Cypress vs
  your normal sessions. We know this may feel a little jarring because you're
  used to running Cypress alongside your other tabs. You will now see 2 chrome
  icons in your dock and you'll need to switch between them. We know this is
  problematic and confusing and we're looking into **changing the icon** of the
  Chrome running Cypress so it's easier to tell the Chrome sessions apart.
- Added new commands to handle getting, setting, and clearing cookies:
  [`cy.clearCookie()`](/api/commands/clearcookie),
  [`cy.getCookie()`](/api/commands/getcookie), and
  [`cy.setCookie()`](/api/commands/setcookie).
- All the `cy.cookie` commands have been upgraded to take new options and can do
  much more powerful things outside of the JavaScript sandbox.
- Upgraded the Chromium version running headlessly and in CI from `47` to `49`.
- There is a new [`cy.exec()`](/api/commands/exec) command that can execute any
  arbitrary system command. Additionally there is a new
  [`execTimeout`](/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts) configuration
  option which is set to `60s` by default. Fixes
  [#126](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/126).
- There is a new
  [`numTestsKeptInMemory`](/guides/references/configuration#Global)
  configuration option that controls how many test's snapshots and command data
  is kept in memory while tests are running. Reducing this number will reduce
  the memory used in the browser while tests are running. Whatever this number
  is - is how many tests you can walk back in time when inspecting their
  snapshots and return values. Addresses
  [#142](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/142).

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress taskbar icon now displays correctly in OS X dark theme. Fixes
  [#132](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/132).
- Fixed issue where server error's stack traces were being truncated in the
  Desktop app rendering them impossible to debug. Fixes
  [#133](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/133).
- woff Fonts are now properly served from a local file system when using
  Cypress' web server. Fixes
  [#135](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/135).
- When an element's center is not visible the error message now includes the
  stringified element in question, and not `undefined`.
- Typing into an `input[type=tel]` now works. Fixes
  [#141](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/141).
- XHR's which have their `onload` handler replaced after `XHR#send` is called is
  now properly accounted for. Fixes
  [#143](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/143).

**Misc:**

- XHR requests for `.svg` files are no longer shown in the Command Log by
  default. Addresses [#131](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/131).
- Improved error when [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) fails. The request
  parameters are now included in the error. Addresses
  [#134](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/134).
- When running a project in the new Cypress browser environment, if a new tab is
  opened, a message now displays discouraging the use of multiple tabs while
  testing. Addresses [#9](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9).
- When navigating directly to `localhost:2020` outside of the new Cypress
  browser environment, a message now displays discouraging running tests outside
  of the new Cypress browser environment.
- If, for whatever reason, Cypress cannot communicate with the automation
  servers, your testing session will immediately end and you'll have the ability
  to re-spawn the browser.
- [`cy.fixture()`](/api/commands/fixture) now has a default timeout of
  `responseTimeout` which is `20s`.
- [`cy.fixture()`](/api/commands/fixture) can now properly time out and accepts
  an `options` argument that can override its default timeout.
- Improved initial Desktop Application startup performance by about `1.5s`.
- We now correctly store local data in each operating system's correct
  `Application Data` area. This will be more resilient to upgrades in the
  future.
- Running Cypress in a linux VM on VirtualBox no longer displays "black
  screens".
- Our internal proxy no longer strips `HttpOnly` cookie flags.
- Improved command errors and normalized many of them. Fixes
  [#137](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/137).
- JavaScript popup blocking is now disabled and will not interfere with running
  tests. Fixes [#125](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/125).
- We now capture synchronous errors from XHR `onreadystatechange` handlers.
