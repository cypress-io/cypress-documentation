## 3.1.0

_Released 8/13/2018_

**Summary:**

- Cypress can now run tests in parallel across multiple virtual machines, or can
  be parallelized on a single machine. Cypress will automatically figure out,
  detect, and load balance all of your specs in the fastest and most efficient
  way possible. There is no configuration other than passing a `--parallel` flag
  and spinning up multiple machines on your CI provider. From our experiments
  you can expect to see approximately 40% reduction in overall run time **per
  machine** you add. However, attempting to run in parallel on a single machine
  requires server grade hardware with dozens (or even hundreds) of CPU's and GB
  of RAM to run efficiently. A much better and simpler approach is to use a
  cluster of docker containers that are all isolated from each other. Any
  standard CI service (CircleCI, TravisCI, etc) comes with the ability to do
  this. We automatically tap into their environment variables to make
  parallelization possible without you having to configure anything.
- Beyond parallelization, you now have the ability to group multiple runs with
  each other so that they show up together (grouped) in the Dashboard. This
  enables you to test different applications, groups of specs, or different
  environments (like development, staging, production) and see all of the
  results together. We know how important cross browser testing is to everyone,
  so we built this to lead directly into aggregating the results of multiple
  browsers into a single run.
- The Dashboard Service has been updated to show you more visual information
  about what happened during a run. You can see how specs were parallelized and
  you can calculate the effect of adding or removing machines to help reduce the
  overall run time.

**Features:**

- `cypress run` accepts a new
  [--parallel](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-parallel) flag to run
  specs in parallel. Fixes
  [#1690](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1690) and
  [#64](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/64) and
  [#2297](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2297).
- `cypress run` accepts a new
  [--group](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-group-lt-name-gt) flag to
  group multiple spec files within a single run. Fixes
  [#2169](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2169)
- `cypress run` accepts a new
  [`--ci-build-id`](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-ci-build-id-lt-id-gt)
  flag. Fixes [#2153](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2153).

**Bugfixes:**

- We've finally tracked down the source of specs "hanging" and failing to start
  when running Electron. We finally tracked it down to a bug in Electron itself
  with setting `menu` when using offscreen rendering. Fixes
  [#2322](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2322) and
  [#2294](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2294) and
  [#1235](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1235) and
  [#1333](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1333).
- Clicking on svg elements is now working. 3.0.2 introduced a bug that would
  throw an 'illegal invocation' error. Fixes
  [#2245](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2245) and
  [#2252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2252) and
  [#2258](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2258) and
  [#2277](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2277) and
  [#2288](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2288).
- Fixed a regression in `3.0.2` that caused typing `{enter}` not to submit a
  form when there were `<button>` elements other than `type='submit'`. Fixes
  [#2261](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2261) and
  [#2326](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2326).
- Fixed a small visual bug where failed commands were not aligned to other
  commands. Fixes [#2314](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2314).
- Fixes a race condition where async electron browser commands came in after the
  renderer had been destroyed, causing failures. Fixes
  [#2321](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2321).

**Misc**

- When recording to the Dashboard Service, we now provide estimated durations
  per spec directly within the standard output, as long as the spec has had
  enough run history for this to be determined. Fixes
  [#2276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2276).
- When using the new
  [--parallel](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-parallel) or
  [--group](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-group-lt-name-gt) feature,
  we now visually indicate that to you in the standard output when recording.
  Fixes [#2275](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2275).
- We have added support for more CI providers to automatically detect and show
  more relevant information in the Dashboard, instead of showing 'Unknown'.
  Fixes [#2146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2146).
- We have added better checks and reliability for detecting runs in Jenkins.
  Fixes [#1990](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1990).
- The built in
  [`cypress-browserify-preprocessor`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-browserify-preprocessor)
  was bumped to `1.1.0`. This supports more JavaScript features by default,
  including async/await, object rest spread, and class properties. Fixes
  [#2254](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2254).
- [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) now creates a new
  browser profile per run per browser, but keeps the same browser profile when
  run via [cypress open](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open). This means
  you can run Cypress locally over multiple processes and the browser profiles
  will not conflict with each other. Fixes
  [#1566](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1566).
- The Desktop-GUI has been updated to get the new routes provided by the Cypress
  API for runs. Fixes
  [#2189](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2189).
- Cypress now retries multiple times (with a backoff strategy) when
  communicating with our API fails while recording runs. This will provide
  better feedback in situations when the API is temporarily unavailable. Fixes
  [#1590](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1590).
- When Cypress retries due to an API timeout or failure it now displays a very
  nice message indicating to you the delay and number of retries left. Fixes
  [#2280](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2280).
- We've added parallelization to our own internal tests for the driver and the
  desktop-gui. We've been able to reduce the number of concurrent instances our
  tests use by 4, and shaved about 6 minutes off of each build. Faster with less
  resources. Fixes [#2325](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2325).
