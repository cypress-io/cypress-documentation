## 9.5.1

_Released 2/28/2022_

**Bugfixes:**

- Added a `ready` event to the Plugins process to ensure all plugins have
  successfully started before the configuration is loaded and the tests start.
  Fixed in [#19792](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19792).
  - This fixes an issue where the plugin is never executed and leaves Cypress
    stuck in the initialization phase, where the user can only view the loading
    spinner.
  - This enables support for node's experimental `--loader` flag for plugins.
- Made a change to the DNS lookup to improve test performances and reliability
  on MacOS machines that leverage the VMWare CBCloud SaaS solution. Before this
  change, random test failures were observed, as well as hanging tests and
  initially pending HTTP and HTTPS responses. Fixed in
  [#20062](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20062).
- Fixed a regression in [9.5.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-5-0) where ANSI
  colors were not removed from the `cy.fixtures()` error code frame. Fixes
  [#20208](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20208).
- Fixed a regression in [9.5.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-5-0) where the
  test config override errors were formatted incorrectly. Fixes
  [#20208](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20208).
- Fixed an issue where Cypress would throw an error when reporting or wrapping
  errors with booleans or numbers. Fixes
  [#19561](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19561).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `url-parse` dependency from `1.5.2` to `1.5.6` to avoid authorization
  bypass through user-controlled key to address this
  [NVD security vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0512).
  Addressed in [#20270](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20270).
