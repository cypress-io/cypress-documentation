## 1.4.1

_Released 12/26/2017_

**Bugfixes:**

- Using `DEBUG=cypress:*` now correctly outputs all debugging information on OSX
  and Linux. Previously output other then `cypress:cli` was ignored due to the
  CLI ignoring `stderr` from the binary. Fixes
  [#921](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/921).
- `stdout` is now captured correctly in Windows when recording to the Dashboard.
  Fixes [#977](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/977) and issue
  [#711](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/711).
- Windows now forcibly displays colors correctly to the terminal. Fixes
  [#1127](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1127).

**Misc:**

- `TTY` is now handled correctly for Linux and OSX. This means that CI providers
  which turned off colors due to `TTY` being false will now display colors again
  such as TravisCI. Fixes
  [#1126](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1126).
- We now handle Xvfb exiting with a non zero status code and display that error
  to you. This should help with situations where Xvfb is misconfigured on the
  system. Fixes [#1113](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1113).
- We've added debug output for Xvfb when `DEBUG=cypress:xvfb` is enabled.
  Helpful when diagnosing problems with Xvfb. Fixes
  [#1128](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1128).
- We've added more TypeScript documentation for `cy.*` methods. Fixes
  [#1117](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1117).
- When developing on Cypress, we now start the process through the CLI to bring
  it into parity with how it works when used in production. Fixes
  [#838](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/838).
- Upgraded various CLI dependencies that were flagged for security warnings.
  There wasn't an actual security problem - just static analyzers complaining.
  Fixes [#1103](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1103).
