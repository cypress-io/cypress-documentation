## 3.8.0

_Released 12/12/2019_

**Features:**

- Chrome can now be run in headless mode by using
  `cypress run --headless --browser chrome`. Addresses
  [#832](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/832).
- Cypress now accepts a
  [--tag](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-tag-lt-tag-gt) argument to be
  used to identify separate runs. Any tags assigned will be shown on the run in
  the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses
  [#2561](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2561).
- The commands [.its()](/api/commands/its) and [.invoke()](/api/commands/invoke)
  now accept an `options` object to allow changing logging options. Addresses
  [#1450](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1450).
- Cypress will now attempt to use the `unzip` binary during `cypress install`
  before trying the slower, Node.js-based unzipping method. Addresses
  [#3803](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3803).

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where Cypress would crash on Windows
  when trying to pass a url through `--config` or `--env` command line flags.
  Fixes [#5466](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5466).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where a supplied `Cookie` header
  during [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) or
  [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) would be overwritten by the `Cookie`
  header generated from the browser's cookie store. Fixes
  [#5894](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5894).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where
  [cy.getCookie()](/api/commands/getcookie) would incorrectly filter cookies by
  their domain, leading to unexpected results. Fixes
  [#5656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5656).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where calling
  `.type({ force: true })` on hidden inputs would not type the correct
  characters. Fixes [#5835](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5835).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where [.type()](/api/commands/type)
  was not respecting previous selections if the current value of the input was
  the same as the key. This also fixed an where [.type()](/api/commands/type)
  would not respect previous selections in non-selectionRange inputs (like email
  or number inputs). Fixes
  [#5703](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5703).
- During visibility checks, Cypress now properly evaluates a DOM element
  transformed by `scale(0)` or `rotateY(90deg)` as not visible. Fixes
  [#723](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/723).
- Fixed a bug where the specs list during `cypress open` would not refresh when
  files are changed on disk. Fixes
  [#5933](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5933).
- `env` configuration option displays properly within the settings panel.
  Previously, setting env options would incorrectly render `"undefined"` as the
  value. Fixes [#5859](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5859).

**Misc:**

- We removed the max viewport size and lowered min viewport size to `0` for
  [cy.viewport()](/api/commands/viewport) Addresses
  [#5871](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5871) and
  [#5892](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5892).
- The Test Runner now shows a non-Chrome logo for
  [browsers passed in via `config.browser`](/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Customize-available-browsers)
  that are not of the Chrome family. It also supports showing the Firefox logo
  (in preparation for Firefox browser support). Fixes
  [#5745](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5745).
- We updated the look of some of our icons. Addressed in
  [#5822](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/5822).

  to JavaScript. Addresses

  URL, including Unicode. Addresses
