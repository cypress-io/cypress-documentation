## 3.8.2

_Released 01/10/2020_

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in [3.8.0](#3-8-0) on Linux when `unzip` is not
  installed where the progress of `cypress install` would show up to 200%. Fixes
  [#5967](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5967).
- We fixed a regression in [3.7.0](#3-7-0) that would prevent
  [.type()](/api/commands/type) from typing valid characters after invalid
  characters were typed in `type="number"` inputs. Fixes
  [#6055](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6055).
- Child elements of an element that uses both `transform` and `height` or
  `width` are now properly seen as visible during visiblity checks. Addresses
  [#5974](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5974).
- We now properly check backface visibility when the parents of a target element
  have the CSS style `transform-style: preserve-3d`. Fixes
  [#5682](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5682).
- DOM elements with a width or height of 0 and `overflow: hidden` are now
  properly calculated as invisible during visibility checks. Fixes
  [#6093](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6093).
- [.should()](/api/commands/should) and [.and()](/api/commands/and) commands
  with function arguments can now be chained with multiple assertions without
  throwing an error. Fixes
  [#4981](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4981).

  brand icons. Addresses

  Command Log instead of the 1 line. Addresses
