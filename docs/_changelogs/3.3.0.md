## 3.3.0

_Released 5/17/2019_

**News:**

- We've
  [written a blog post](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/05/22/how-we-improved-network-speed-by-300-in-cypress-3-3-0/)
  about the 300% increase in proxy performance delivered in `3.3.0`.

**Features:**

- Cypress now automatically reads from your system's `HTTP_PROXY`,
  `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables and proxies traffic
  accordingly through Cypress based on these values. This includes network
  traffic within your application under test, when downloading Cypress, and when
  accessing 'Runs' within the Test Runner. Please read our new
  [Proxy Configuration](/guides/references/proxy-configuration) doc to
  understand more about proxy configuration in Cypress. Fixes

- Requests that go through [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) or
  [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) are now automatically retried under the
  hood when the request fails. This more closely reflects Chrome's default
  behavior on requests. Addresses

- [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) and [cy.request()](/api/commands/request)
  now support new options `retryOnStatusCodeFailure` and `retryOnNetworkFailure`
  to allow changing Cypress's automatic request retry on status codes and
  network errors. Addresses
  [#4013](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4013),
  [#898](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/898) and

- We now indicate which XHRs match which alias in the Command Log on
  [.wait()](/api/commands/wait) when they match an alias multiple times.
  Addresses [#477](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/477).
- The console log when clicking on the [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) command
  now displays its resolved `options` arguments. Addresses
  [#3721](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3721).
- There's a new 'canceled' XHR status shown on the Command Log to indicate the
  difference between calling `xhr.abort()` and the browser canceling the request
  due to page navigation. Addresses
  [#3973](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3973).
- The Electron browser now runs Chrome Version 61. Addresses
  [#4000](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4000).

  [#3977](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3977)

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression introduced in [3.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0)
  that caused an error to throw when visiting domains with certain public
  suffixes. Fixes [#3717](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3717).
- When running Cypress with `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variables set, Cypress no
  longer issues an incorrect 0 exit code.
  [#1676](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1676)
- Fixed a regression introduced in [3.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0)
  that caused [.its()](/api/commands/its) to no longer retry when it yields
  `undefined`. [#3837](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3837)
- Fixed a regression introduced in [3.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0)
  that caused [cy.fixture()](/api/commands/fixture) to throw a `EISDIR` error if
  a directory had the same name as a file within that same directory. Fixes
  [#3739](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3739).
- `user-agent` headers sent as arguments to
  [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) and [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit)
  are now properly sent. Fixes
  [#3873](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3873) and
  [#3719](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3719).
- When a request is proxied through Cypress and there is a network error, we no
  longer send an HTML response with a 500 status code. We now kill the
  browser-facing socket and let the network error be handled by the application
  under test. Fixes [#4101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4101),
  [#4231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4231),
  [#1036](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1036),
  [#4231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4231), and
  [#1398](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1398).
- We changed Cypress's implementation to no longer rely on internal XHR events
  when the browser navigates. This fixes a a bug in Chrome 71+ that could cause
  XHRs to pend forever. Fixes
  [#3973](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3973) and
  [#4130](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4130)
- We greatly improved the speed of proxied requests through our network layer.
  Fixes [#3192](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3192) and
  [#1469](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1469).
- If an error occurs during `cypress verify`, we now kill the verification
  process after 10 seconds and print the error message. This should prevent some
  situations where Cypress would hang during installation or verification and
  never exit. Fixes [#819](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/819).
- Cypress automatically retries `cypress verify` and `cypress run` commands by
  starting its own Xvfb server on Linux if the first attempt fails due to
  possible `DISPLAY` misconfiguration. Addresses
  [#4034](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4034).
- Cypress now properly handles typing JavaScript object prototype methods (like
  `hasOwnProperty`) into [`.type()`](/api/commands/type). Fixes
  [#3423](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3423).
- We now set the `form` option to `true` if the `Content-Type` header equals
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `json` is not already set by a user.
  This fixes a situation where Cypress would try to parse the `body` as a
  string, resulting in a confusing error message. Fixes
  [#2923](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2923).
- [cy.contains()](/api/commands/contains) now correctly handles comma delimited
  arguments passed to the selector argument. Fixes
  [#2407](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2407).
- Passing a browser path containing spaces now works properly when passed to the
  `--browser` argument. Fixes
  [#3979](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3979)
- Fixed display of tooltips when selecting elements from the Selector Playground
  so that they display at the correct coordinates when scrolling. Fixes
  [#1351](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1351).
- The lists of spec files now display at the correct indentation level when they
  are nested more than 5 directories deep. Fixes
  [#3652](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3652).
- Cypress now properly parses environment variables with empty values. Fixes
  [#3742](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3742).
- Assertions running outside of a test are now properly handled in Cypress
  instead of throwing internal errors. Fixes
  [#3926](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3926).
- [Cypress.log()](/api/cypress-api/cypress-log) now throws an error when not
  properly passed an object as its argument. Addresses
  [#3658](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3658).
- [Cypress.log()](/api/cypress-api/cypress-log) no longer throws when called
  before any other Cypress commands. Fixes
  [#3658](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3658).

**Misc:**

- We now better support capturing environment variables within Azure DevOps.
  Addresses [#3657](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3657).
- Cypress now only scans for spec changes when the watcher sees changes, rather
  than polling to scan. Addresses
  [#3069](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3069).
- The ability to open the context menu to see "Inspect Element" has been
  reenabled in the Electron browser. Addresses
  [#4002](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4002).
- We no longer package non-Windows FFmpeg builds with Windows builds, resulting
  in a 35-40% reduction in zipped size and a 36-43% reduction in unzipped size
  of download. Addresses
  [#3888](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3888).
- The warning messages when going over test recording limits have been updated
  to correctly display 'monthly tests' and 'private tests' where necessary.
  Addresses [#4024](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4024).
- When an HTTP request is received by the proxy layer, by default, we send it
  with a `Connection: keep-alive` header so that the connection will be reused
  if possible. Addresses
  [#3857](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3857).
- Improved accessibility of Test Runner for screen readers. Addresses
  [#3850](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3850).
- Cypress type definition now allow a `timeout` option in
  [cy.hash()](/api/commands/hash). Fixes
  [#3844](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3844).

  `RegExp` type arguments. Fixes
  [#2578](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2578).

  `options` to be `ObjectLike`. Addressed in
  [#3809](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3809).
- The [cy.clock()](/api/commands/clock) type definition now allows for type
  `Date`. Fixed in [#4106](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4106).
- Added type definition for undocumented `Cypress.LocalStorage.clear` method.
  Fixes [#4070](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4070).
- Added type definition for [Cypress.isCy()](/api/cypress-api/iscy) method.
  Fixes [#3822](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3822).
- Added missing type definitions for some [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit)
  options. Fixes [#3989](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3989).
