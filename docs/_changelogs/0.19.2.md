## 0.19.2

_Released 04/16/2017_

**Features:**

- You can now run your tests in the
  [Electron browser](/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Electron-Browser) that
  comes built with Cypress. You will see it as an option in the browser
  dropdown. This is the same browser that Cypress uses when running
  `cypress run`. This is useful for debugging issues that only occur during
  headless runs. Addresses
  [#452](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/452).
- New traversal commands [`.nextAll()`](/api/commands/nextall),
  [`.nextUntil()`](/api/commands/nextuntil),
  [`.parentsUntil()`](/api/commands/parentsuntil),
  [`.prevAll()`](/api/commands/prevall), and
  [`.prevUntil()`](/api/commands/prevuntil) have been added. Addresses
  [#432](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/432).

**Bugfixes:**

- An error is now thrown if an `undefined` value is mistakenly passed into
  [`cy.wait()`](/api/commands/wait). Previously, it would set the command
  timeout to an unimaginably large number of ms. Fixes
  [#332](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/332)
- Fixed issue where the contents of `state.json` were emptied, which would cause
  a crash and loss of state information. Fixes
  [#473](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/473) and
  [#474](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/474).
- We no longer write the chrome extension within `node_modules`, and instead
  write this to the proper OS specific `appData` folder. Fixes
  [#245](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/245) and
  [#290](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/290).

**Misc:**

- Error handling for invalid arguments passed to
  [`cy.wait()`](/api/commands/wait) have been improved and will now suggest
  valid arguments that are acceptable.
- Browsers in the browser dropdown now have colored icons, which help visually
  distinguish the variants of Chrome.
- Increased timeout for browser to make a connection when running during
  `cypress run` from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.
- Internally refactored how browsers are added and spawned in preparation of us
  adding cross browser support.
- Switching specs in the GUI now closes the browser and respawns it and
  refocuses it.
