## 0.3.12

_Released 03/26/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- Aliases which replay their commands will no longer break the current chain and
  therefore not unintentionally null our their subject for the ext command.
- Highlighting $el's on DOM restore now works again.
- Asserting against [`cy.focused()`](/api/commands/focused) will indent command
  logs now.
- Prevent failed [`.should()`](/api/commands/should) and `cy.to` from outputting
  a second error'd command log.
- Removed memory leaks surrounding Mocha runner.
- Captured remote page uncaught errors again which fail corresponding tests.
- Captured spec iframe errors again and preserve their stack trace.

**Misc:**

- [`cy.focused()`](/api/commands/focused) is now a parent command.
- Memory usage improvements.
