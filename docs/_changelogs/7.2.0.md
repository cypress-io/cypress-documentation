## 7.2.0

_Released 04/26/2021_

**Features:**

- You can now navigate through folders in the Test Runner using the Tab keyboard
  input and open or close the folder's content with the Enter & Space keyboard
  inputs. Addresses [#3741](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3741).

**Performance:**

- Fixed a regression in [7.0.0](/guides/references/changelog#7-0-0) that caused
  tests to run slowly, especially when run with constrained CPU resources. Fixes
  [#15853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15853).
- Fixed a regression in [7.0.0](/guides/references/changelog#7-0-0) causing
  decreased performance in Chromium browsers due to requesting screencast frames
  when video is disabled. Fixes
  [#16030](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16030).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in [7.0.0](/guides/references/changelog#7-0-0) that caused
  the Test Runner to crash with an `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE` type error. We now
  correctly detect a utf8 request body with multi-byte Unicode characters. Fixes
  [#15901](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15901).

  as the 3rd argument" error when using `cy.intercept`. Fixes
  [#16117](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16117).
- `cypress run-ct` no longer hangs on Windows machines. Fixes
  [#15976](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15976).

  `Cannot read property 'name' of null`. Fixes
  [#15816](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15816).
- We now throw an error when attempting to `.select()` an `<option>` within a
  disabled `<fieldset>`. Fixes

- `.type()` will no longer change the `value` attribute of button-like inputs
  with type button, submit, reset, image, radio, or checkbox. Fixes
  [#15913](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15913).
- Specs will now load when using a relative directory for `componentFolder`
  outside of the root project when specifying `--project`. Fixes
