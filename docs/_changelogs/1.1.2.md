## 1.1.2

_Released 11/26/2017_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression caused by [.type()](/api/commands/type) adhering to
  `maxlength` incorrectly. Special character sequences were not respected. Now
  [.type()](/api/commands/type) works with special characters and implements a
  complete fix for `maxlength`. In addition to it working, it now fires all
  applicable browser events without modifying the actual input value. Fixes
  [#955](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/955).
- Errors coming from plugins now display correctly in the Test Runner. Fixes
  [#945](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/945).
