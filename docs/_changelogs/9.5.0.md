## 9.5.0

_Released 2/15/2022_

**Features:**

- Enhancements were made to the error experience in both run mode and open mode
  to improve readability and provide meaningful stack traces. Addressed in
  [#20124](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20124).
- Updated the `cy.request()` log message to hide the origin when it matched the
  browser origin to make debugging easier. This reduces the length of the log
  message that could be partially hidden if a long url is requested. Addressed
  in [#20009](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20009).
- Updates were made to log the `ShadowRoot` and `Document` elements as HTML
  elements. Previously these would be logged as enumerated objects, which were
  difficult to evaluate. Addressed in
  [#20049](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20049).
- Updated the terminal output generated in Cypress run mode to de-emphasis the
  `node` path in the run header. Addressed in
  [#20120](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20120).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where files attached during `.selectFile()` could have the
  wrong `File` prototype. Fixes
  [#20003](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20003).
- Updated `.select()` to only dispatch the `change` and `input` events when the
  selected option is not the currently selected option. This change aligns
  `.select()` with the browser. Fixes
  [#19494](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19494).
- Updated `.type(' ')` to align with the W3C standards where a click event
  should be dispatched when the Space key is pressed and the current focus is on
  a state-changing element with type `button`, `image`, `submit` or `reset`.
  Fixes [#20067](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20067).
