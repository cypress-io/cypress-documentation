## 4.10.0

_Released 7/7/2020_

**Features:**

- You can open a `before`, `beforeEach`, `after`, and `afterEach` hook
  definition in your IDE from the Test Runner's
  [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) by clicking the
  **Open in IDE** button. Addresses
  [#7793](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7793).
- `before`, `beforeEach`, `after`, and `afterEach` hook definitions now display
  separately in the Test Runner's
  [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) when defined in
  separate hook definitions. Addresses
  [#7779](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7779).
- You can now open a spec file directly from the **Tests** tab in the Test
  Runner by clicking the **Open in IDE** button. Addresses
  [#7713](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7713)

**Bugfixes:**

- HTTP requests taking longer than the default `responseTimeout` will no longer
  be prematurely canceled by the Cypress proxy layer. Fixes
  [#6426](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6426).
- Using Cypress commands to traverse the DOM on an application with a global
  `parent` variable will no longer throw Illegal Invocation errors. Fixes
  [#6412](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6412).
- When [experimentalShadowDomSupport](/guides/references/experiments#Shadow-DOM)
  is enabled, using [.type()](/api/commands/type) on an input in the Shadow DOM
  will not result in an error. Fixes
  [#7741](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7741).
- When [experimentalShadowDomSupport](/guides/references/experiments#Shadow-DOM)
  is enabled, checking for visibility on a shadow dom host element will no
  longer hang if the host element was the foremost element and had an ancestor
  with fixed position. Fixes
  [#7893](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7893).
- Debug logs from the `@benmalka/foxdriver` module will no longer appear if any
  `DEBUG` environment variable was set. Fixed
  [#7723](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7723).

**Misc:**

- We made some minor UI updates to the Test Runner. Addresses
  [#7732](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7732) and
  [#7803](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7803).

**Dependency Updates:**
