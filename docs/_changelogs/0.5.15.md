## 0.5.15

_Released 05/07/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- Reverted `window.location` overrides. This broke things in unexpected ways and
  after further testing would not have worked on `Firefox` and `IE`. It's back
  to the drawing board (but I have some ideas). Apps using `pushState` routing
  are broken again.
