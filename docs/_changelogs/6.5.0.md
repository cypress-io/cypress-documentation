## 6.5.0

_Released 2/15/2021_

**Performance:**

- Improved the startup time of `cypress open` and `cypress run`. Addresses
  [#15075](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15075).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where tests would display as failed if an event (such as an XHR
  request) failed after the test was already completed. This only affects the
  display of the test and not what was reported in run mode, so it would not
  have had an effect on suites running in CI. Addresses
  [#14978](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14978).
- Fixed a regression introduced in 6.4.0 that caused Electron to crash when
  opening outside links in the Command Log. Addresses
  [#14912](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14912).
- Fixed an issue where browser paths with double backslashes would not work as
  expected on Windows. Addresses
  [#14719](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14719).
- Fixed Microsoft Edge browser detection when passing a path on Windows.
  Addresses [#14716](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14716).
- Fixed an issue where the types for `Cypress.on` did not support chaining.
  Addresses [#14991](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14991).
- Fixed an issue where, when installing two Cypress instances simultaneously,
  the downloaded `.zip` could become corrupted and break the install process.
  Addresses [#4595](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4595).

  [#9590](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9590).
