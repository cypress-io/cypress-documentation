## 0.5.10

_Released 04/28/2015_

**Features:**

- [`cy.server()`](/api/commands/server) now accepts a `delay` option which will
  delay all responses to requests (including 404) based on the value in ms
- [`cy.server()`](/api/commands/server) now accepts a `respond` option which can
  turn off automatic responding to requests.
- [`cy.route()`](/api/commands/route) now accepts a `delay` option which
  overrides the delay option set in [`cy.server()`](/api/commands/server) to
  just matched requests.
- [`cy.route()`](/api/commands/route) now accepts a `respond` option which will
  turn off automatic responding to just matched requests.
- Fixes [#14](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14).
- [`cy.wait()`](/api/commands/wait) now accepts an alias property called
  `request`. Example: `cy.wait('@getUsers.request')` which ill resolve once the
  XHR is initially requested, before it is responded to. This allows you to test
  things when a request is in flight.
- Added `cy.respond` command which will respond to all pending requests when
  `{respond: false}` is set in the `server` or `route`.
- [`.debug()`](/api/commands/debug) now displays pending requests and completed
  requests.
- The command UI now displays pending requests as a `pending command`.

**Misc:**

- Updated `sinon` to `1.14.1`.
