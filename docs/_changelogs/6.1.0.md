## 6.1.0

_Released 12/07/2020_

**Features:**

- There's a new `scrollBehavior` configuration option that controls the viewport
  position when an element is scrolled prior to action commands. Possible values
  are `'top'`, `'bottom'`, `'center'`, `'nearest'`, and `false`, with `'top'`
  being the default. `scrollBehavior: false` disables scrolling altogether.
  `scrollBehavior` can be specified in
  [global configuration](/guides/references/configuration#Actionability),
  [test configuration](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Configuration)
  or individual
  [action commands](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements) via
  `options`. Addresses [#871](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/871)
  and [#4356](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4356).
- The **Tests** tab in the Test Runner now orders folders before files. This
  matches the ordering of most IDEs' file explorers. Addresses
  [#7334](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7334).

**Bugfixes:**

- Responses stubbed from [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) will now
  automatically set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and
  `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` to permissive values unless explicitly
  overridden. Fixes [#9264](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9264).
- The `Cannot read property "fireChangeEvent" of undefined` error will no longer
  throw during a race condition when using
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). Fixes
  [#9170](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9170).
- HTTP responses that cannot have a body (like HTTP 304 and HTTP 204) can now be
  awaited using [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). Fixes
  [#8934](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8934) and
  [#8999](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8999).
- We fixed an issue where HTTP redirects could not be awaited using
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) unless dynamically intercepted.
  Addressed in [#9097](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/9097).
- Tests will no longer hang in certain situations when there's an error in a
  `before()` hook. Fixes
  [#9162](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9162).
- We no longer strip `/` from URLs when they are explicitly passed with query
  paramaters. Fixes [#9360](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9360).
- Fixed the regression in `Cypress.dom.isVisible` behavior for elements with
  `position: fixed`, addresses
  [#8998](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8998) and
  [#9031](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9031).

**Deprecations:**

Deprecations still work as before but will be removed from Cypress in a future
release. We encourage you to update your code now to remove uses of
deprecations.

- `Cypress.moment` has been deprecated and will be replaced in a future release.
  Consider migrating to a different datetime formatter. Addresses
  [#8714](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8714).

**Misc:**

- We collect more environment variables from Bitbucket to better detect reruns.
  Addresses [#9309](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9309).
- `waitForAnimations` and `animationDistanceThreshold` types are now included
  for all actionable commands. Addresses
  [#8854](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8854).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `mocha-junit-reporter` from `1.23.1` to `2.0.0`. Addressed in
  [#9528](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9528).
