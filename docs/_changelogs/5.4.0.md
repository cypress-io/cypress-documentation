## 5.4.0

_Released 10/14/2020_

**Features:**

- You can now run
  [cypress cache prune](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-cache-prune) to
  delete all installed Cypress versions from the cache except for the
  currently-installed version. Addresses
  [#5972](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5972).
- There's a new `--size` option for the
  [cypress cache list](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-cache-list) command
  that prints the sizes of the Cypress cache folders. Addresses
  [#6404](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6404).
- For video recordings of runs, there is now a video chapter key for each test.
  If your video player supports chapters, you can move to the start of each test
  right away. Addresses
  [#3626](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3626).
- In Windows, you can now append the browser type to the end of the path passed
  to the `--browser` flag, like
  `cypress open --browser C:/User/App/browser.exe:chrome`, to help detect the
  browser type. Addresses
  [#6389](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6389).
- [cy.viewport()](/api/commands/viewport) has new `iphone-7`, `iphone-8`, and
  `iphone-se2` presets. Addressed in
  [#8624](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8624)
- When there is a new version of Cypress available, the update modal has a new
  design with 'copy to clipboard' buttons to copy the upgrade commands.
  Addressed in [#8751](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/8751).
- The [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Command-Log) can be hidden
  by passing the `CYPRESS_NO_COMMAND_LOG=1` environment variable during
  `cypress open` or `cypress run` to be used as a tool to debug performance
  issues. Addressed in
  [#8689](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8689).

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in [5.8.0](#5-8-0) where the `chromeWebSecurity` option
  had no effect in Electron. Fixes
  [#8399](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8399).
- Tests will no longer hang and now properly throw when there is an error thrown
  from a `test:after:run` event listener. Fixes
  [#2271](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2271) and
  [#8701](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8701).
- When a command is chained after [.within()](/api/commands/within) and
  [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get) is called inside it, the scope will no longer
  permanently change. Fixes

  [#4672](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4672),

  [.each()](/api/commands/each) commands now query as expected. Fixes
  [#4921](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4921).

  [#2101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2101).
- When using [`cy.route2()`](http) the route handler timeouts will no longer
  leak into other tests and cause random failures. Addressed in
  [#8727](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8727).
- The `request.body` is now available when using [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait)
  on an aliased [`cy.route2()`](http) route which had not been intercepted.
  Fixes [#8695](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8695).

  the Cypress Dashboard. Fixes

  version of Firefox newer than 80. Fixes

  Test Runner. Fixed in
  [#8745](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8745).
- Fixed an issue where preprocessor-related plugins would cause tests not to run
  and a duplicate instance of Cypress to be spawned. Fixes
  [#8634](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8634).
