## 0.17.2

_Released 09/06/2016_

**Notes:**

- After this update if you are seeing `<iframe>` origin errors _please let us
  know_ by [opening an issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/new).
  We will screen-share with you to diagnose the issue. We're no longer aware of
  any situation where this should happen, so if you're experiencing these bugs,
  please help us track them down.

**Features:**

- Attempting to [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) a non `text/html` resource
  will now throw a specific error message instead of bombing on page injection
  with an `<iframe`> origin error. You have to visit actual `html`, you cannot
  visit something like a `.json` or `.png`. If you're wanting to visit an API
  route on your back end that does something like set cookies (thus avoiding
  loading your UI) you can just use [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) for
  this since it will now automatically get and set cookies under the hood. Fixes
  [#211](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/211).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in `0.17.1` that was incorrectly setting `Cache` headers.
  This _could_ cause a situation where you received an `<iframe>` origin error.
  Additionally we now set `No-Cache` headers whenever we inject content, but
  otherwise respect the headers coming from web servers. When using Cypress as
  the file server, we set `etags` but prevent caching.
- Most likely fixed a bug that was crashing Cypress due to
  `Cannot set headers after they've been sent`. We were unable to write a test
  for this since we could not recreate the error, but analyzed how it _may_
  happen and fixed the code there.
  [open an issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/new) if you see
  this error, it will be obvious since Cypress will literally crash.
- We stopped minifying `vendor.js` (for real this time). More optimizations to
  come around this.
- Prevented accidentally setting `domain` cookies when they were really
  `hostOnly` cookies, thus duplicating the number of cookies sent on requests.
  Kudos to [@bahmutov](https://github.com/bahmutov) for finding this one. Fixes
  [#207](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/207).
- Fixed some edge cases in `cypress-core-extension` where it threw errors when
  attempting to `executeScript` on a tab with `about:blank` or `chrome://` urls.
- We've fixed some underlying issues with [`cy.go()`](/api/commands/go) during
  `cypress run`. It always worked fine in real Chrome. Previously there were
  some situations where it would not navigate forward / back correctly.

**Misc:**

- No longer force [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) to navigate to
  `about:blank` prior to navigating to the real url. Fixes
  [#208](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/208).
- [`cy.writeFile()`](/api/commands/writefile) can now accept an empty string.
  Fixes [#206](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/206).
- Improved error messages for [`cy.readFile()`](/api/commands/readfile) and
  [`cy.writeFile()`](/api/commands/writefile).
- The full file path is now included in console output for
  [`cy.readFile()`](/api/commands/readfile) and
  [`cy.writeFile()`](/api/commands/writefile).
- The [Kitchen Sink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink)
  and `example_spec.js` have been updated to reflect the newest changes and
  features of `0.17.1`.
