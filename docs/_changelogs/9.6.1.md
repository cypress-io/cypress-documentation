## 9.6.1

_Released 5/9/2022_

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress can now launch on systems where Firefox is installed via Snapcraft.
  Fixed [#19793](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19793).
- Updates were made to ensure XHR calls are properly displaying the response
  body in the command log. Fixed
  [#21361](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21361).
- Fixed [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) and
  [`.should('contain', ...)`](/api/commands/should) to handle finding text that
  contains backslash characters. Fixed
  [#19116](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19116)
- Updated [`.type('{enter}')`](/api/commands/type) to support sending the Enter
  keystroke to submit buttons that are not rendered within a form html element,
  but are associated with a form via the `form` attribute. Fixed
  [#21163](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21163).
- Fixed an issue with `cy.session()` such that re-running tests in open mode
  will now correctly recreate a session. Before this change, an error was thrown
  indicating the saved `setup` function was not a function because it was
  serialized. Fixed
  [#17805](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17805).
