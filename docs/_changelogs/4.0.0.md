## 4.0.0

_Released 2/6/2020_

**Summary:**

Cypress 4.0.0 includes support for
[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) browsers (beta support) and
[Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (Chromium based) browsers which
is a big step forward for
[Cross Browser Testing](/guides/guides/cross-browser-testing) in Cypress. We've
also updated many of the [underlying tools](/guides/references/bundled-tools)
behind Cypress that bring new powerful features.

**Breaking Changes:**

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> Please read our
[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes
in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 4.0.**

- Mocha, Chai, and Sinon.JS has been upgraded which includes a number of
  breaking changes and new features. Addresses
  [#2528](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2528),
  [#2529](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2529),
  [#2866](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2866).
- During `before:browser:launch`, we no longer yield the second argument as an
  array of browser arguments and instead yield an `options` object with an
  `args` property in order to support more advanced browser launch options.
  Addresses [#6306](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6306).
- We updated the [Cypress browser objects](/api/plugins/browser-launch-api) of
  all Chromium-based browsers, including Electron, to have `chromium` set as
  their `family` field. Addresses
  [#6243](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6243).
- The
  [`--browser` flag](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-browser-lt-browser-name-or-path-gt)
  no longer accepts `canary` as its sole argument to run Chrome Canary. You now
  have to specify `chrome:canary` to use the Chrome Canary browser. Addresses
  [#6243](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6243).
- [.contains()](/api/commands/contains) now ignores leading, trailing, duplicate
  whitespaces. Addresses [#92](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/92).
- [cy.writeFile()](/api/commands/writefile) now yields `null` instead of the
  contents written to the file in order to more align with the behavior of `fs`.
  Addresses [#2466](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2466).
- Installing Cypress on your system now requires Node.js 8+. Addresses
  [#5632](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5632).
- Cypress no longer support CJSX. Addresses
  [#3469](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3469).

  now supported. Addresses
  [#5433](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5433).
- There is a new [Cypress.isBrowser()](/api/cypress-api/isbrowser) utility
  function. Addresses
  [#2023](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2023).
- We updated the [Cypress.browser](/api/cypress-api/browser) object with a new
  `channel` property which contains the release channel of the detected browser.
  Addresses [#6243](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6243).
- There is a new `matchCase` option for [.contains()](/api/commands/contains).
  Addresses [#2785](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2785).
- Appending `.only` to multiple tests or suites will now run all tests with the
  `.only` property. Addresses
  [#2828](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2828).
- The [`isFinite` assertion](/guides/references/assertions) is now supported.
  Addresses [#5669](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5669).

  [#5004](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5004).

**Bugfixes:**

  contained the same title now run correctly. Fixes
  [#5345](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5345).
- The [.its()](/api/commands/its) command now properly supports 0 as a value for
  indexes or object keys. Fixes
  [#6216](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6216).

**Documentation Changes:**

- Added [Cross Browser Testing Guide](/guides/guides/cross-browser-testing) with
  helpful CI strategies to consider when running tests across multiple browsers.

**Misc:**
