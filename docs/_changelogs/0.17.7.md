## 0.17.7

_Released 10/12/2016_

**Features:**

- There is now a new
  [`chromeWebSecurity`](/guides/references/configuration#Browser) option you can
  set in `cypress.json` to turn off Chrome's Web Security features. We've
  written a brand new reference that details why and how you could use this.
  [Cypress Web Security](/guides/guides/web-security). This option can be used
  for accessing `cross origin` `<iframes>` or if your application needs to test
  navigation across super domains. Fixes
  [#262](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/262).

**Bugfixes:**

- We now capture `cross origin` errors correctly instead of these showing as
  `Uncaught DOMExceptions` in the console. Fixes
  [#261](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/261).
- We no longer trash the wrong folder on OSX in-app updates (when a project is
  open). Sorry about this! Fixes
  [#260](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/260).
- [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) urls with domain-like segments (which
  weren't actually the domain) no longer cause Cypress to think you're trying to
  navigate to a different superdomain. Fixes
  [#255](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/255).
