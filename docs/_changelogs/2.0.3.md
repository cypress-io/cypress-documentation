## 2.0.3

_Released 2/21/2018_

**Bugfixes:**

- The runner no longer appears to "hang" if a `before` hook fails in a test with
  siblings. Previously the test would never generate a `status` and look pending
  forever. This was a visual bug only. Fixes
  [#1343](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1343).
- The Desktop GUI properly renders folders that contain specs in Windows now.
  Fixes [#1335](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1335).

**Misc:**

- The viewport dropdown helper in the Runner now displays string quoted JSON
  instead of an object literal. This better matches how you should write those
  options in `cypress.json`. Fixes
  [#1350](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1350).
