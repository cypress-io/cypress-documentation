## 2.0.0

_Released 2/15/2018_

**Breaking Changes:**

- The built in default `Electron` browser has been bumped from version `53` to
  `59`. This version represents the version of `Chromium` that Electron is
  using. In other words, running `cypress run` (or via `Electron`) will be like
  running your tests in `Chrome 59` now. Although it is unlikely this would
  actually _break_ any of your tests - it is technically possible they could
  behave differently. Fixes
  [#895](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/895) and
  [#891](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/891) and
  [#823](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/823) and
  [#860](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/860) and
  [#1011](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1011) and
  [#1252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1252) and
  [#1276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1276).
- We are now detecting and automatically stripping code that obstructs Cypress
  from being able to test your application. Specifically, we are removing
  JavaScript code that tries to prevent **clickjacking** and **framebusting**.
  We have written very conservative rules that do their best to **only** strip
  these specific JS snippets, but it is technically possible that it may
  unintentionally rewrite valid JS if they match the RegExp patterns. There is a
  new configuration option called
  [modifyObstructiveCode](/guides/references/configuration#Browser) that is
  `true` by default. If you are experiencing problems after upgrading, you can
  turn this off and this will disable modifying your JS code. If you were using
  Cypress and upon visiting your website you would experience seemingly "random"
  redirects - these problems should now be eliminated. Fixes
  [#886](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/886) and
  [#1245](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1245) and
  [#1064](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1064) and
  [#992](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/992) and
  [#692](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/692) and
  [#352](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/352).
- We are now clearing the browser's disk cache each time it opens (before any
  tests run). This means that any files that have been cached from
  `Cache-Control` headers will be cleaned and removed. In the future, we will
  expose a new `cy.clearCache()` method to provide finer grained control of
  clearing the cache on a per test basis. But for now, this is an improvement.
  Fixes [#1124](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1124).
- The `--spec` option is now normalized against the current working directory
  `cwd` instead of the project that you are running Cypress in. That means
  passing a path from the command line to a spec file will now work even when
  the project path is not `cwd`. Fixes
  [#1159](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1159).

**Bugfixes:**

- [blacklistHosts](/guides/references/configuration#Browser) would occasionally
  not work if you were blocking a host that had previously cached a file. In
  this case, the browser would serve it from disk and not make an actual HTTP
  request. This issue has been solved by clearing the cache when the browser
  opens. Fixes [#1154](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1154).
- [blacklistHosts](/guides/references/configuration#Browser) is now correctly
  accepted via the `--config` CLI flag.
- Spies and Stubs created with [cy.stub()](/api/commands/stub) and
  [cy.spy()](/api/commands/spy) will now retry their assertions when utilized
  from an [alias](/api/commands/as). Fixes
  [#1156](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1156).
- Basic auth is working again in Chrome 63 and Chrome 64. We "for real" fixed it
  this time by adding auth headers automatically at the network proxy layer and
  bypassed the browser altogether. We automatically apply auth headers if you
  provide a username/password in the URL of a `cy.visit(url)`. We also added a
  new `auth` option to specify the `username/password` using
  `cy.visit(url, options)`. All of the requests that match the origin of the URL
  will have the `Authorization: Basic <...>` headers added. Fixes
  [#1288](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1288).
- Fixed domain parsing failures when `local` or `localhost` was not used as a
  `tld`. Fixes [#1292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1292) and
  [#1278](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1278).
- Removed the flag `--disable-background-networking` from the Chrome launch args
  to fix problems in CI that would throttle XHR callbacks by up to 20-30
  seconds. Fixes [#1320](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1320).

**Misc:**

- We now properly display nested objects and arrays that come from
  `cypress.json` in the Settings tab in the Desktop Application.
- There's now a proper "empty view" when you go to setup your project to record
  on our Dashboard and you have not created any Organizations. Fixes
  [#1306](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1306).
- Removed the message about private projects requiring a paid account in the
  future. There will be a free tier including private projects. Fixes
  [#827](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/827).
- We moved the location of the browser's disk cache. That means that if you've
  been using Cypress for a really long time - you may have built up quite a
  large existing cache (in the hundreds of `mb`). Before upgrading, you should
  open the browser and then manually clear the Cache. Or - if you have already
  upgraded to `2.0.0` delete the following folders:
  - OSX: `~/Library/Caches/Cypress`
  - Linux: `~/.cache/Cypress`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Cypress\cy\production\browsers`
