## 3.3.1

_Released 5/23/2019_

**News:**

- We've
  [written a blog post](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/05/22/how-we-improved-network-speed-by-300-in-cypress-3-3-0/)
  about the 300% increase in proxy performance delivered in
  [3.3.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-3-0).

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress no longer accidentally prints internal Electron logs when running
  `cypress run`. This bug would exhibit itself when verifying and running
  Cypress the first time after installation. You may have seen these logs when
  running in CI. Fixes
  [#4255](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4255).
- Fixed a bug for users running external network proxies that prevented requests
  from completing. Requests should now all work correctly. Fixes
  [#4257](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4257).
- Fixed a regression in [3.3.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-3-0) causing
  large requests such as `multipart/form-data` uploads to hang. Fixes
  [#4240](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4240),
  [#4252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4252), and
  [#4253](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4253).
- Fixed issue where support for `have.focus`, `not.have.focus`, `be.focused` and
  `not.be.focused` [assertions](/guides/references/assertions) were not working.
  Fixes [#4265](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4265).
- Names given to [`.as()`](/api/commands/as) now work properly when they contain
  a `.` character. Fixes
  [#3512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3512).
- The proper error is now thrown when passing `{log: false}` to a Cypress
  command that failed. Fixes
  [#3847](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3847).
- Fixed an issue where highlighting a command's snapshot would throw an error
  when no application was rendered in the AUT frame. Fixes
  [#4177](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4177).
- We now properly detect the branch name when running Cypress in AppVeyor. Fixed
  in [#4234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4234).

**Misc:**

- Fix capitalization of `Xvfb` in error messages. Addressed in
  [#4262](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4262).

**Documentation Changes:**

  [Chinese](http://on.cypress.io/zh-cn) and [Japanese](http://on.cypress.io/ja).
