## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> What is the Dashboard?

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/dashboard-runs-list.png" alt="Dashboard Screenshot" ></DocsImage>

The [Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) is a Cypress service that gives
you access to tests you've recorded - typically when running Cypress tests from
your [CI provider](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction). The Dashboard
provides you insight into what happened during your tests run.

You can read more [here](/guides/dashboard/introduction).

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> How do I record my tests?

1. First [set up the project to record](/guides/dashboard/projects#Setup).
2. Then [record your runs](/guides/dashboard/runs).

After recording your tests, you will see them in the
[Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) and in the "Runs" tab of the
Cypress App.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> How much does it cost?

Please see our [Pricing Page](https://www.cypress.io/pricing) for more details.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> What counts as a test result?

Which [pricing tier](https://www.cypress.io/pricing) is best for you depends on
the number of test you record each month in your organization.

Tests are recorded when [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run)
is called with the `--record` flag while supplying the record `--key`. This
means your [test run data](/guides/dashboard/runs) is being "recorded" to the
Dashboard.

We consider each time the `it()` function is called to be a single test. So you
will generally have several tests recorded within each spec file and likely
several spec files within a single run. Only the
[passed and failed tests](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-statuses)
are counted. The pending and skipped tests are NOT counted.

You can always see how many tests you've recorded from your organization's
[Billing & Usage](/guides/dashboard/organizations#Billing-Usage) page within the
Dashboard.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> What counts as a user?

A [user](/guides/dashboard/users) is anyone with a login to our Dashboard
Service that has been invited to see and review the test results of your
organization.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> What is the difference between public and private projects?

**A public project** means that anyone can see the recorded runs for it. It's
similar to how public projects on Github, Travis, or Circle are handled. Anyone
who knows your `projectId` will be able to see the recorded runs, screenshots,
and videos for public projects.

**A private project** means that only [users](/guides/dashboard/users) you
explicitly invite to your [organization](/guides/dashboard/organizations) can
see its recorded runs. Even if someone knows your `projectId`, they will not
have access to your runs unless you have invited them.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> How is this different than CI?

Cypress is **complementary** to your
[CI provider](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction), and plays a
completely different role.

It doesn't replace or change anything related to CI. You will run Cypress tests
in your CI provider.

The difference between our [Dashboard Service](/guides/dashboard/introduction)
and your CI provider is that your CI provider has no idea what is going on
inside of the Cypress process. It's programmed to know whether or not a process
failed - based on whether it had an exit code greater than `0`.

Our [Dashboard Service](/guides/dashboard/introduction) provides you with the
low level details of _what_ happened during your run. Using both your CI
provider + Cypress together gives the insight required to debug your test runs.

When a run happens and a test fails - instead of going and inspecting your CI
provider's `stdout` output, you can log into the
[Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard), see the `stdout` as well as
screenshots and video of the tests running. It should be instantly clear what
the problem was.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> Can I host the Dashboard data myself?

No, although we are looking to build an on-premise version of the Dashboard for
use in private clouds.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> Can I choose not to use the Dashboard?

Of course. The Dashboard Service is a separate service from the Cypress App and
will always remain optional. We hope you'll find a tremendous amount of value in
it, but it is not coupled to being able to run your tests.

You can always run your tests in CI using
[cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) without the `--record`
flag which does not communicate with our external servers and will not record
any test results.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> What is my Organization ID?

Your Organization ID is a unique identifier that is linked to your organization.
Instructions on how to find your ID are in the
[Dashboard Guide.](/guides/dashboard/organizations#Organization-ID)

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> What does Cypress record?

We capture the following:

- Standard Output
- Test Failures
- Screenshots
- Video

We have already begun the implementation for capturing even more things from
your run such as:

- Commands
- Network Traffic
- Browser Console Logs

These will be added in subsequent releases.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> Why is test parallelization based on spec files and not on the individual functions?

Cypress [test parallelization](/guides/guides/parallelization) is indeed based
on specs. For each spec the Cypress App scaffolds the new running context, in a
sense isolating each spec file from any previous spec files, and ensuring a
clean slate for the next spec. Doing this for each _individual_ test would be
very very expensive and would slow down the test runs significantly.

Spec file durations are also more meaningful and consistent than timings of
individual tests, we can order specs by the moving average of the previously
recorded durations. This would be much less useful when load balancing quickly
finishes individual tests.

Thus, to better load balance the specs, you would want more spec files with
approximately the same running duration. Otherwise, a single very long running
test might limit how fast all your tests finish, and how fast the run completes.
Due to starting a new test execution context before each spec file and encoding
and uploading video after, making spec files run shorter than approximately 10
seconds would also be fruitless - because Cypress overhead would eat any time
savings.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> My CI setup is based on Docker, but is very custom. How can I load balance my test runs?

Even if your CI setup is very different from the
[CI examples we have](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Examples) and
[run with our sample projects](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink#ci-status),
you can still take advantage of the test load balancing using the Dashboard.
Find a variable across your containers that is the same for all of them, but is
different from run to run. For example it could be an environment variable
called `CI_RUN_ID` that you set when creating the containers to run Cypress. You
can pass this variable via CLI argument
[`--ci-build-id`](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-ci-build-id-lt-id-gt)when
starting Cypress in each container:

```shell
cypress run --record --parallel --ci-build-id $CI_RUN_ID
```

For reference, here are
[the variables](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/server/lib/util/ci_provider.js)
we extract from the popular CI providers, and for most of them there is some
variable that is set to the same value across multiple containers running in
parallel. If there is NO common variable, try using the commit SHA string.
Assuming you do not run the same tests more than once against the same commit,
it might be good enough for the job.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> Can I delete a run from the Dashboard?

You can [archive a run](guides/dashboard/runs#Archive-run) so that it does not
display in the runs list or in analytics.

**Note:** Archiving the recorded runs has no effect on the amount of tests
recorded and counted as your usage billed for the month.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> Can I delete my Cypress account?

You can delete your Cypress account from
[your Dashboard profile](https://dashboard.cypress.io/profile). Deleting your
account cannot be undone! By deleting your Cypress account, all associated data
in your account will be permanently deleted.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> What happens to my Dashboard if I downgrade my account?

Downgrading your account will **not** result in loss of access to your
Dashboard.

However, it will make your Dashboard subject to the limitations of your new
plan. For example, downgrading to the _Seed_ plan will limit data retention to
30 days and test results to 500 per billing period.

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> What happens once I reach the test results limit?

Tests running with the `--record` flag will run as normal when the limit is
reached, but parallelization will be disabled and new test results will be
hidden from the dashboard until your plan is upgraded or a new usage cycle
begins. The usage cycle resets each month.

In order to avoid any interruption in service, we recommend that you review your
usage and select a plan that satisfies your usage requirements. You can do this
by:

1. Logging into the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.cypress.io)
2. Select your organization
3. Navigate to the **Billing and Usage** tab
4. Review your organization's usage
5. Scroll down and select **Upgrade** under your plan of choice

## <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> I'm working at a restrictive VPN. Which subdomains do I have to allow on my VPN for the Dashboard to work properly?

To send the data and results of your tests to the
[Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard-introduction), Cypress needs free
access to some URLs.

If you are running the tests from within a restrictive VPN you will need to
allow some URLs so that Cypress can have effective communication with the
Dashboard.

**The URLs are the following:**

- `https://api.cypress.io` - **Cypress API**
- `https://assets.cypress.io` - **Asset CDN** (Org logos, icons, videos,
  screenshots, etc.)
- `https://authenticate.cypress.io` - **Authentication API**
- `https://dashboard.cypress.io` - **Dashboard app**
- `https://docs.cypress.io` - **Cypress documentation**
- `https://download.cypress.io` - **CDN download of Cypress binary**
- `https://on.cypress.io` - **URL shortener for link redirects**
