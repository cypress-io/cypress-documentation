# Views

<UICovAddon />

UI Coverage is organized into views, which are the unique URLs across all snapshots from end-to-end tests and the unique mounted components from component tests.

### Grouping

UI Coverage uses certain default rules to generate a single view from dynamic URLs that represent the same page:

- All search parameters are removed.
- All hash parameters are removed, unless the hash parameter starts with a `/`, such as `#/admin`.
- If there are multiple URLs that are exactly the same except for a different integer or UUID value in the same path parameter, then that path parameter is replaced with a wildcard (`*`).

These rules can be overriden via [views.md](/ui-coverage/configuration/views configuration.
