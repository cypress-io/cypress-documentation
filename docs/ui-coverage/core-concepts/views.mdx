# Views

UI Coverage organizes all unique URLs across snapshots from end-to-end tests and mounted components from component tests into "Views". A View represents a distinct page or state in your application.

## View Creation & Grouping

By default, UI Coverage uses certain rules to generate a single View from dynamic URLs that represent the same page:

- All search parameters are removed
- Hash parameters are removed (unless they start with `/`, such as `#/admin`)
- If multiple URLs differ only by an integer or UUID in the same path parameter, that parameter is replaced with a wildcard (`*`)

For example:

- `/users/123/profile` and `/users/456/profile` would be grouped into `/users/*/profile`
- `/dashboard?tab=overview` and `/dashboard?tab=settings` would be grouped into `/dashboard`
- `/app#settings` and `/app#profile` would be grouped into `/app`
- `/app#/admin` and `/app#/settings` would remain separate Views

## Using Views

In the UI Coverage interface, Views are listed with their coverage scores, helping you:

- See which areas of your application have been tested
- Identify untested pages and components
- Track changes in coverage across different parts of your application
- Focus testing efforts on critical paths and flows

You can customize how URLs are grouped into Views using [views](/ui-coverage/configuration/views) and [viewFilters](/ui-coverage/configuration/viewfilters) configuration options.
