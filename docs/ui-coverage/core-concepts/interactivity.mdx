# Interactivity

## Interactive Elements

UI Coverage uses a set of rules, based on HTML semantics, [WHATWG standards](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/dom.html#interactive-content), as well as some additional rules defined by Cypress, to determine which elements are interactive. Some examples of elements that are considered interactive and are thereby included in UI Coverage are:

- **Elements with implicit interactive roles** such as elements with a tag of `a`, `button`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, etc.
- **Elements with explicit interactive roles** such as elements with a `role` attribute set to `button`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `tab`, `textbox`, etc.
- **Elements with a `tabindex` attribute set to >= 0.**

## Interaction Commands

UI Coverage considers interactive elements "tested" if they are interacted with by a Cypress command. The commands that are considered interactions are:

- `blur`
- `check`
- `clear`
- `click`
- `dblclick`
- `focus`
- `rightclick`
- `scrollIntoView`
- `scrollTo`
- `select`
- `selectFile`
- `submit`
- `trigger`
- `type`
- `uncheck`
