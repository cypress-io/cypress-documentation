# Interactivity

## Interactive Elements

UI Coverage determines interactivity based on a combination of HTML semantics, [WHATWG standards](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/dom.html#interactive-content), and Cypress-specific rules. Interactive elements included in UI Coverage are:

- **Implicit interactive roles**: Elements with a tag of `a`, `button`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, etc.
- **Explicit interactive roles**: Elements with a `role` attribute set to values like `button`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `tab`, `textbox`, etc.
- **Tab-navigable elements**: Elements with a `tabindex` attribute set to `>= 0`.

These elements are tracked for interaction to provide actionable insights into test coverage.

## Interaction Commands

Interactive elements are marked as "tested" when they are interacted with using specific Cypress commands. These include:

- `blur`
- `check`
- `clear`
- `click`
- `dblclick`
- `focus`
- `rightclick`
- `scrollIntoView`
- `scrollTo`
- `select`
- `selectFile`
- `submit`
- `trigger`
- `type`
- `uncheck`

By ensuring these commands interact with the appropriate elements, UI Coverage accurately reflects your test coverage.

## Untested Links

UI Coverage tracks `<a>` elements (links) that are not visited during testing. For each untested link, detailed information is available:

### Referrers

The **Referrers** section identifies views that contain links to the untested destination, helping you:

- Pinpoint untested areas referenced from these links.
- Understand navigation paths leading to untested sections.
- Gain context on where these links appear within your application.

### URLs

The **URLs** section groups similar patterns for dynamic routing. For instance, links to `/users/1`, `/users/2`, and `/users/3` are grouped as /users/\*. This grouping aids in:

- Understanding the scope of dynamic routes in your application
- Viewing the count and variations of a URL pattern.
- Writing configuration rules to handle these patterns effectively.
