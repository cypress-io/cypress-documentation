# Interactivity

## Interactive Elements

UI Coverage determines interactivity based on a combination of HTML semantics, [WHATWG standards](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/dom.html#interactive-content), and Cypress-specific rules. Interactive elements included in UI Coverage are:

- **Implicit interactive roles**: Elements with a tag of `a`, `button`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, etc.
- **Explicit interactive roles**: Elements with a `role` attribute set to values like `button`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `tab`, `textbox`, etc.
- **Tab-navigable elements**: Elements with a `tabindex` attribute set to `>= 0`.

These elements are tracked for interaction to provide actionable insights into test coverage.

### Customizing interactive elements

Custom interactive elements that do not meet the criteria above can also be declared with a `data-cy-ui-interactive="include"` attribute, used as follows:

```html
<div data-cy-ui-interactive="include"> Custom interactive widget</div>
```

It most cases we recommend **not** using this override, and instead updating the HTML to be something the browser would already consider to be interactive. This will likely produce better overall behavior, including for accessibility purposes. `data-cy-ui-interactive` is a fallback for situations where that may not be possible.

## Interaction Commands

Interactive elements are marked as "tested" when they are interacted with using specific Cypress commands. These include:

- `blur`
- `check`
- `clear`
- `click`
- `dblclick`
- `focus`
- `rightclick`
- `scrollIntoView`
- `scrollTo`
- `select`
- `selectFile`
- `submit`
- `trigger`
- `type`
- `uncheck`

By ensuring that at least one of these commands is used on every interactive element, UI Coverage accurately reflects your test coverage.

### Customizing interaction commands

Configuration is available to support adding [additional interaction commands](/ui-coverage/configuration/additionalinteractioncommands), such as custom commands or ones from third-party libraries, to count towards UI Coverage scores.

It is also possible to adjust the [allowed commands](/ui-coverage/configuration/allowedinteractioncommands) for specific elements, to restrict or expand the commands that are accepted as coverage for specific elements.


## Untested Links

UI Coverage tracks `<a>` elements (links) that are not visited during testing. For each untested link, detailed information is available:

### Referrers

The **Referrers** section identifies views that contain links to the untested destination, helping you:

- Pinpoint untested areas referenced from these links.
- Understand navigation paths leading to untested sections.
- Gain context on where these links appear within your application.

### URLs

The **URLs** section groups similar patterns for dynamic routing. For instance, links to `/users/1`, `/users/2`, and `/users/3` are grouped as /users/\*. This grouping aids in:

- Understanding the scope of dynamic routes in your application
- Viewing the count and variations of a URL pattern.
- Writing configuration rules to handle these patterns effectively.
