# Element Identification

<UICovAddon />

Elements are uniquely identified across views and snapshots by their HTML attributes, location, and other signals in the DOM.

It is important for elements to have unique and stable identifiers so that UI Coverage can track and de-duplicate them throughout the many different snapshots captured in your tests.

UI Coverage considers the following attributes to have special significance for the purposes of identification and grouping:

- `data-cy`
- `data-test`
- `data-testid`
- `data-test-id`
- `data-qa`
- `row-id`
- `id`
- `name`

Element identification can be configured via [attributefilters](/ui-coverage/configuration/attributefilters) and [significantattributes](/ui-coverage/configuration/significantattributes) configuration.
