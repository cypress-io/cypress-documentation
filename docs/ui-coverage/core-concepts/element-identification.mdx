# Element Identification

UI Coverage uniquely identifies elements across views and snapshots using a combination of HTML attributes, location, and other signals in the DOM. Stable and unique identifiers are crucial for accurately tracking and de-duplicating elements throughout the various snapshots captured in your tests.

## Significant attributes for identification

Certain attributes are prioritized by UI Coverage for element identification and grouping. These include:

- `data-cy`
- `data-test`
- `data-testid`
- `data-test-id`
- `data-qa`
- `row-id`
- `id`
- `name`

By using these attributes consistently in your application, you can improve the accuracy of UI Coverage tracking.

## Configuring element identification

### Attribute filters

Exclude irrelevant or dynamically generated attributes to reduce noise in UI Coverage reports. For example:

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "attributeFilters": [
      {
        "attribute": "id",
        "value": ":r.*:",
        "include": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Learn more about attribute filtering in the [Attribute Filters](/ui-coverage/configuration/attributefilters) guide.

### Significant attributes

Define custom significant attributes to prioritize specific selectors that align with your applicationâ€™s structure. For example:

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "significantAttributes": ["data-custom-id"]
  }
}
```

Refer to the [Significant Attributes](/ui-coverage/configuration/significantattributes) guide for detailed instructions.
