# views

<UICovAddon />

:::info
Note: setting views impacts both Accessibility and UI Coverage reports.
Nesting this property under an `accessibility` or `uiCoverage` key is
supported, if you need to split them up.
:::

UI Coverage automatically groups certain URL patterns to create [views](/ui-coverage/core-concepts/views). For URLs that are not automatically grouped (e.g. `/users/alice` and `/users/bob` are not automatically grouped into `/users/*`), the `views` property allows you to specify URL patterns that represent views.

Each URL pattern provided defines a view that is made up of all URLs that match the pattern. The first pattern that a given URL matches is used as its view. If a URL doesn't match any of the patterns, it is grouped by the default UI Coverage grouping rules, if possible.

The `groupBy` property of a view definition allows you to create multiple views with a single URL pattern, grouping URLs by the specified named parameter(s).

## Syntax

```json
{
  "views": [
    {
      "pattern": string,
      "groupBy": [
        string
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### views

_Optional._ Object\[]

An array of objects used to define views within UI Coverage. _**Each object can have the following properties:**_

### pattern

_Required._ String (URL Pattern)

A URL pattern that groups matching URLs into a single view. This utilizes the [URL Pattern API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API) syntax for matching.

### groupBy

_Optional._ String\[]

An array of named URL parameters used to further subdivide the URLs into multiple views within the same pattern. When `groupBy` is defined, each URL that matches the specified `pattern` is further analyzed to create separate views based on the specified parameters. This is particularly useful in dynamic applications where URLs represent different user interactions or data segments.

## Examples

### Grouping dynamic path parameters

#### Config

```typescript
{
  "views": [
    {
      "pattern": "https://cypress.io/users/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Visited URLs

```
https://cypress.io/users/alice
https://cypress.io/users/alice?foo=bar
https://cypress.io/users/bob
https://cypress.io/users/bob#baz
```

#### Views shown in UI

```
https://cypress.io/users/*
```

---

### Using named path parameters

#### Config

```json
{
  "views": [
    {
      "pattern": "https://cypress.io/users/:name"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Visited URLs

```
https://cypress.io/users/alice
https://cypress.io/users/alice?foo=bar
https://cypress.io/users/bob
https://cypress.io/users/bob#baz
```

#### Views shown in UI

```
https://cypress.io/users/:name
```

---

### Grouping URLs by named path parameters

#### Config

```json
{
  "views": [
    {
      "pattern": "https://cypress.io/analytics/:type/:id",
      "groupBy": ["type"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Visited URLs

```
https://cypress.io/analytics/performance/foo
https://cypress.io/analytics/performance/bar
https://cypress.io/analytics/usage/foo
https://cypress.io/analytics/usage/bar
```

#### Views shown in UI

```
https://cypress.io/analytics/performance/:id
https://cypress.io/analytics/usage/:id
```

---

### Grouping URLs by named query parameters

#### Config

```json
{
  "views": [
    {
      "pattern": "https://cypress.io/app?*name=:name{&*}?#*",
      "groupBy": ["name"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Visited URLs

```
https://cypress.io/app?foo=1&name=hello
https://cypress.io/app?name=hello&bar=2
https://cypress.io/app?foo=3&name=world&bar=4
https://cypress.io/app?foo=5&name=world#baz
```

#### Views shown in UI

```
https://cypress.io/app?name=hello
https://cypress.io/app?name=world
```

---

### Grouping URLs by path parameters to ignore dynamic hosts

#### Config

```json
{
  "views": [
    {
      "pattern": "https://*.cypress.io/:path*",
      "groupBy": ["path"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Visited URLs

```
https://sub1.cypress.io/home
https://sub2.cypress.io/home
https://sub3.cypress.io/profile
https://sub4.cypress.io/profile/edit
```

#### Views shown in UI

```
https://*.cypress.io/home
https://*.cypress.io/profile
https://*.cypress.io/profile/edit
```
