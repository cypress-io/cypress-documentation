# viewFilters

<UICovAddon />

:::info
Note: setting `viewFilters` impacts both Accessibility and UI Coverage reports.
This cannot be nested.
:::

By default, every URL that is visited within a run is included in UI Coverage. The `viewFilters` property allows you to specify URL patterns for URLs that should be excluded from UI Coverage. Excluding a URL also excludes all links to that URL.

For every URL visited by Cypress in a run and every link element found, the first `viewFilters` rule for which the `pattern` property matches the URL is used to either include or exclude the URL based on the `include` value. URLs that do not match any rules are included by default.

## Syntax

```json
{
  "viewFilters": [
    {
      "pattern": string,
      "include": boolean
    }
  ]
}
```

### viewFilters

_Optional._ Object\[]

An array of objects used to specify URLs to exclude from UI Coverage. _**Each object can have the following properties:**_

### pattern

_Required._ String (URL Pattern)

Used to match URLs. Uses [URL Pattern API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API) syntax.

### include

A boolean that represents whether or not a matched URL should be included in UI Coverage.
