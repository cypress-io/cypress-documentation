# viewFilters

By default, every URL visited within a test run is included in UI Coverage. However, not all URLs are relevant for your coverage analysis. The `viewFilters` property allows you to specify patterns for URLs that should be excluded, ensuring your coverage reports focus on meaningful parts of your application. Excluding a URL also excludes all links pointing to that URL.

## Why use view filters?

:::info
**Note:** setting `viewFilters` impacts both Accessibility and UI Coverage reports. This cannot be nested.
:::

- **Exclude Third-Party URLs**: If your application integrates with third-party services, you might want to exclude their URLs from coverage analysis.
- **Exclude Admin Pages**: URLs that are not part of the user-facing application, such as admin pages, could be excluded from coverage reports.
- **Reduce Noise**: Certain URLs visited during tests (e.g., error pages or redirects) may not represent meaningful user flows. Exclude these to clean up your reports.
- **Optimize Performance**: Filtering out irrelevant URLs reduces the amount of data processed, speeding up analysis and improving report readability.

## Syntax

```json
{
  "viewFilters": [
    {
      "pattern": string,
      "include": boolean
    }
  ]
}
```

### Options

For every URL visited and link element found, the first `viewFilters` rule for which the `pattern` matches the URL is used to either include or exclude the URL based on the `include` value. URLs that do not match any rules are included by default.

| Option    | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pattern` | Required |         | A string that matches URLs using [URL Pattern API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API) syntax. |
| `include` | Optional | `true`  | A boolean that determines whether matching URLs should be included in coverage.                                              |
