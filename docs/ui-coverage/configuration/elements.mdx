# elements

<UICovAddon />

UI Coverage provides automatic logic to [identify](/ui-coverage/core-concepts/element-identification) elements based on their DOM structure. However, in complex applications, elements may lack stable identifiers or have dynamic attributes that vary across snapshots, leading to incorrect identification. The `elements` configuration allows you to specify selectors to uniquely identify elements, ensuring consistency across snapshots and simplifying your coverage reports.

The `elements` configuration is used as the element's identity if **only one element** per snapshot matches. If there are multiple matches in the same snapshot, this configuration is ignored and the default [identify](/ui-coverage/core-concepts/element-identification) strategy is used.

## Why use elements configuration?

**Common use cases**

- **Handle Dynamic Attributes**: Ensure elements are consistently identified across snapshots, even when attributes change.
- **Ensure Unique Identification**: Use custom selectors to uniquely identify elements across snapshots that lack unique attributes or have dynamic values, avoiding misclassification.
- **Simplify Debugging**: Assign human-readable names to elements to make reports more interpretable and debugging easier.

## Syntax

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "elements": [
      {
        "selector": string,
        "name": string
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Properties

- `selector` (Required): A CSS selector to identify elements. Supports standard CSS selector syntax, including IDs, classes, attributes, and combinators.
- `name` (Optional): A human-readable name for the element, displayed in UI Coverage reports. The selector is used as the element name if no name is provided.

## Examples

### Identify elements by dynamic selector across snapshots

#### Config

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "elements": [
      {
        "selector": "#my-form [id^='dropdown']"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### HTML

```xml
<!-- Snapshot 1 -->
<body>
  <form id="my-form">
    <input id="dropdown-142"></input>
  </form>
</body>

<!-- Snapshot 2 -->
<body>
  <form id="my-form">
    <input id="dropdown-980"></input>
  </form>
</body>
```

#### Elements shown in UI Coverage

```
#my-form [id^="dropdown"]
```

### Identify elements with human-readable names

#### Config

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "elements": [
      {
        "selector": "#ui-popover-button",
        "name": "Help Popover"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### HTML

```xml
<body>
  <button id="ui-popover-button">Help</button>
</body>
```

#### Elements shown in UI Coverage

```
Help Popover
```
