# coverageRules

<UICovAddon />

UI Coverage has default rules for determining which elements are interactive and what commands count as interactions. The `coverageRules` configuration property allows you to define additional rules for what elements should be tracked and which commands constitute coverage for those elements.

These rules augment (rather than replace) the default interactive element detection, which is based on HTML semantics and WHATWG standards. This allows you to extend UI Coverage to track custom components or count specific commands as coverage without modifying your application code.

## Syntax

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "coverageRules": [
      {
        "selector": string,
        "commands": string[]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### coverageRules

_Optional._ Object[]

An array of objects used to define custom coverage rules for UI Coverage. _**Each object can have the following properties:**_

### selector

_Required._ String (CSS Selector)

A CSS selector that identifies elements that should be tracked for coverage. The selector can match any valid CSS selector syntax.

### commands

_Required._ String[]

An array of Cypress command names that should count as coverage for elements matching the selector.

## Examples

### Track Custom Components

#### Config

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "coverageRules": [
      {
        "selector": ".custom-button",
        "commands": ["click"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### HTML

```xml
<body>
  <div class="custom-button">Click Me</div>
</body>
```

#### Elements tracked in UI Coverage

```
.custom-button
```

### Count Assertions as Coverage

#### Config

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "coverageRules": [
      {
        "selector": "h1, h2",
        "commands": ["should"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Test Code

```javascript
cy.get('h1').should('be.visible')
cy.get('h2').should('contain', 'Welcome')
```

Both headings will be marked as tested in UI Coverage reports.

### Multiple Rules for Different Elements

#### Config

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "coverageRules": [
      {
        "selector": "[data-testid='custom-dropdown']",
        "commands": ["click"]
      },
      {
        "selector": ".status-indicator",
        "commands": ["should"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### HTML

```xml
<body>
  <div data-testid="custom-dropdown" class="dropdown">
    <div class="dropdown-value">Select an option</div>
    <div class="dropdown-options">
      <div class="option">One</div>
      <div class="option">Two</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="status-indicator">Active</div>
</body>
```

#### Test Code

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="custom-dropdown"]').click()
cy.get('.status-indicator').should('contain', 'Active')
```

Both elements will be tracked and marked as tested when the specified commands are used.
