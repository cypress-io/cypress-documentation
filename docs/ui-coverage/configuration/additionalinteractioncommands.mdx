# additionalInteractionCommands

UI Coverage automatically tracks interactions with elements during test execution using a predefined set of interaction commands. The `additionalInteractionCommands` configuration allows you to extend this default set by specifying custom command types that should also be recognized as interactions, ensuring comprehensive coverage tracking for applications using custom or third-party interaction patterns.

## Why use additionalInteractionCommands?

- **Custom Command Support**: Track interactions from custom Cypress commands that aren't included in the default set.
- **Third-party Library Support**: Ensure interactions from third-party testing libraries are properly recognized and tracked.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Get complete visibility into all user interactions, including domain-specific or application-specific commands.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Improve the accuracy of your UI Coverage reports by including all relevant interaction types.

## Syntax

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "additionalInteractionCommands": [
      string
    ]
  }
}
```

### Options

The `additionalInteractionCommands` property accepts an array of strings, where each string represents a command name that should be treated as an interaction command by UI Coverage.

| Option                         | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `additionalInteractionCommands` | Optional | `[]`    | An array of command names (strings) that should be recognized as interaction commands in addition to the defaults. |

## Examples

### Adding custom interaction commands

#### Config

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "additionalInteractionCommands": [
      "customClick",
      "dragAndDrop",
      "swipeLeft"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Usage in tests

```javascript
// These custom commands will now be tracked as interactions
cy.get('[data-testid="submit-button"]').customClick()
cy.get('[data-testid="draggable"]').dragAndDrop()
cy.get('[data-testid="carousel"]').swipeLeft()
```

### Adding third-party library commands

#### Config

```json
{
  "uiCoverage": {
    "additionalInteractionCommands": [
      "realClick",
      "realType",
      "realHover"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Usage in tests

```javascript
// Commands from cypress-real-events plugin will be tracked
cy.get('[data-cy="button"]').realClick()
cy.get('[data-cy="input"]).realType('Hello World')
cy.get('[data-cy="tooltip-trigger"]').realHover()
```

## Notes

- Command names are case-sensitive and must match exactly as they appear in your test code.
- The additional commands are merged with the default interaction commands, not replaced.
- Only commands that actually interact with DOM elements should be included in this configuration.
- Custom commands must log a snapshot that references the subject element. This ensures that the command renders element highlights in Cypress open mode/Test Replay, and also ensures that UI Coverage can properly attribute the interaction to the expected element. More information regarding Custom Commands can be found [here](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands).
