# elementFilters

<UICovAddon />

:::info
Note: setting `elementFilters` impacts both Accessibility and UI Coverage
reports. Nesting this property under an `accessibility` or `uiCoverage` key is
supported, if you need to split them up.
:::

By default, every interactive and visible element is included in UI Coverage. The `elementFilters` property allows you to specify selectors for elements that should be excluded from these reports. This configuration is particularly useful for removing irrelevant or non-actionable elements to streamline coverage analysis.

## Why use element filters?

**Common use cases**

- **Excluding Irrelevant Elements**: Decorative icons, marketing banners, or tooltips that do not require testing can clutter reports. Use elementFilters to exclude them.
- **Streamlining Reports**: Reducing noise by filtering out non-essential elements makes coverage reports more actionable.
- \*\*Improving Grouping Accuracy:
  Avoid incorrectly grouping elements that share attributes but serve different purposes.

Example: Ensure buttons with different actions are not grouped together due to generic data-\* attributes.

## Syntax

```json
{
  "elementFilters": [
    {
      "selector": string,
      "include": boolean
    }
  ]
}
```

### Properties

- `selector` (Required): A CSS selector to identify elements. Supports standard CSS selector syntax, including IDs, classes, attributes, and combinators.
- `include` (Optional): A boolean indicating whether the matched elements should be included in UI Coverage. Default to `true` (elements are included by default).

## Examples
