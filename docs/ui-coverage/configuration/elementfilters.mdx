# elementFilters

By default, every interactive and visible element is included in UI Coverage. The `elementFilters` property allows you to specify selectors for elements that should be excluded from these reports. This configuration is particularly useful for removing irrelevant or non-actionable elements to streamline coverage analysis.

## Why use element filters?

:::info
**Note:** setting `elementFilters` impacts both Accessibility and UI Coverage
reports if set at the root of the configuration. Nesting this property under an `accessibility` or `uiCoverage` key is
supported, if you need to split them up.
:::

- **Excluding Irrelevant Elements**: Decorative icons, marketing banners, or tooltips that do not require testing can clutter reports. Use elementFilters to exclude them.
- **Ignoring 3rd Party Components**: Libraries or widgets that are not part of your application logic can be excluded from coverage reports.
- **Streamlining Reports**: Reducing noise by filtering out non-essential elements makes coverage reports more actionable.

## Syntax

```json
{
  "elementFilters": [
    {
      "selector": string,
      "include": boolean
    }
  ]
}
```

### Options

For every element considered interactive and visible by UI Coverage, the first `elementFilters` rule for which the selector property matches the element is used to either include or exclude the element based on the `include` value. Elements that do not match any rules are included by default.

| Option     | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `selector` | Required |         | A CSS selector to identify elements. Supports standard CSS selector syntax, including IDs, classes, attributes, and combinators. |
| `include`  | Optional | `true`  | A boolean indicating whether the matched elements should be included in UI Coverage.                                             |
