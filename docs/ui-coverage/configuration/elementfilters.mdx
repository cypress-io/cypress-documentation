# elementFilters

<UICovAddon />

:::info
Note: setting `elementFilters` impacts both Accessibility and UI Coverage
reports. Nesting this property under an `accessibility` or `uiCoverage` key is
supported, if you need to split them up.
:::

By default, every interactive and visible element is included in UI Coverage. The `elementFilters` property allows you to specify selectors for elements that should be excluded from UI Coverage.

For every element considered interactive and visible by UI Coverage, the first `elementFilters` rule for which the `selector` property matches the element is used to either include or exclude the element based on the `include` value. Elements that do not match any rules are included by default.

## Syntax

```json
{
  "elementFilters": [
    {
      "selector": string,
      "include": boolean
    }
  ]
}
```

### elementFilters

_Optional._ Object\[]

### selector

A boolean that represents whether or not a matched element should be included in UI Coverage.
