# Configuration

Configuration enables you to customize and fine-tune UI Coverage in Cypress to suit the unique needs of your application. While UI Coverage is designed to work seamlessly out of the box, there are scenarios where fine-tuning may be necessaryâ€”such as dealing with dynamic attributes, filtering out irrelevant elements, or grouping related components. These guides explain how to configure UI Coverage effectively to improve accuracy and usability.

**Note**: By default, setting configuration is limited to Admin users. At your request, this can be changed to allow setting config by all users. Reach out to your Cypress point-of-contact if you would like to change this.

## Setting configuration

To add or modify the configuration for your project:

1. Navigate to the **App Quality** tab in your project settings on Cypress Cloud.
2. Use the configuration editor to add or edit confiuration in JSON format.

## Configuration options

A complete configuration with all available options looks as follows:

```json
{
  "elementFilters": [
    {
      "selector": string,
      "include": boolean
    }
  ],
  "views": [
    {
      "pattern": string,
      "groupBy": [
        string
      ]
    }
  ],
  "viewFilters": [
    {
      "pattern": string,
      "include": boolean
    }
  ],
  "uiCoverage": {
    "attributeFilters": [
      {
        "attribute": string,
        "value": string,
        "include": boolean
      }
    ],
    "elementGroups": [
      {
        "selector": string,
        "name": string
      }
    ],
    "significantAttributes": [
      string
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration scope

The root-level properties `elementFilters` and `viewFilters` apply to both UI Coverage and Accessibility. These properties can also be nested under `uiCoverage` or `accessibility` to apply to only that product, with nested configuration taking precedence over root-level configuration.

The `views` property applies to UI Coverage and Accessibility but cannot be nested.

## Viewing Configuration for a Run

You can review the configuration used during a specific run by checking the **Properties** tab, as shown below. This displays the configuration as it was applied at the start of the run.
