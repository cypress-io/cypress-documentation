# Configuration

Configuration enables you to customize and fine-tune UI Coverage in Cypress to suit the unique needs of your application. While UI Coverage is designed to work seamlessly out of the box, there are scenarios where fine-tuning may be necessary—such as dealing with dynamic attributes, filtering out irrelevant elements, or grouping related components. These guides explain how to configure UI Coverage effectively to improve accuracy and usability.

**Note**: By default, setting configuration is limited to Admin users. At your request, this can be changed to allow setting config by all users. Reach out to your Cypress point-of-contact if you would like to change this.

## New configuration options

UI Coverage now supports defining custom commands that will count towards coverage scores, restricting which kinds of interactions are allowed for certain elements, and including assertions in the UI Coverage calculations. See the following new properties for more details:

- [`additionalInteractionCommands`](/ui-coverage/configuration/additionalinteractioncommands)
- [`allowedInteractionCommands`](/ui-coverage/configuration/allowedinteractioncommands)

## Setting configuration

To add or modify the configuration for your project:

1. Navigate to the **App Quality** tab in your project settings on Cypress Cloud.
2. Use the configuration editor to add or edit confiuration in JSON format.

### Comments

All configuration objects support an optional `comment` property that you can use to provide context and explanations for why certain values are set. This helps make your configuration easier to understand and maintain, especially when working in teams or revisiting configuration after some time.

```json
{
  "elementFilters": [
    {
      "selector": "[data-testid*='temp']",
      "include": false,
      "comment": "Exclude temporary test elements from coverage"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Profiles

The `profiles` property allows you to use different configuration settings for different runs based on [run tags](/app/references/command-line#cypress-run-tag-lt-tag-gt). See the [Profiles](/ui-coverage/configuration/profiles) guide for more details.

### Complete configuration example

A complete configuration with all available options looks as follows:

```json
{
  "elementFilters": [
    {
      "selector": string,
      "include": boolean,
      "comment": string
    }
  ],
  "views": [
    {
      "pattern": string,
      "groupBy": [
        string
      ],
      "comment": string
    }
  ],
  "viewFilters": [
    {
      "pattern": string,
      "include": boolean,
      "comment": string
    }
  ],
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": string,
      "config": {
        // Any App Quality configuration options
      }
    }
  ],
  "uiCoverage": {
    "attributeFilters": [
      {
        "attribute": string,
        "value": string,
        "include": boolean,
        "comment": string
      }
    ],
    "elementGroups": [
      {
        "selector": string,
        "name": string,
        "comment": string
      }
    ],
    "significantAttributes": [
      string
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration scope

The root-level properties `elementFilters` and `viewFilters` apply to both UI Coverage and Accessibility. These properties can also be nested under `uiCoverage` or `accessibility` to apply to only that product, with nested configuration taking precedence over root-level configuration.

The `views` property applies to UI Coverage and Accessibility but cannot be nested.

## Viewing Configuration for a Run

You can review the configuration used during a specific run by checking the **Properties** tab, as shown below. This displays the configuration as it was applied at the start of the run.
