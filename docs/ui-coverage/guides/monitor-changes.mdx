# Monitor changes

Monitoring changes to your UI Coverage scores over time ensures that regressions are identified and addressed before they are merged. Cypress UI Coverage provides tools to track these changes, enabling proactive quality assurance in your development workflow.

## Automate monitoring with the Results API

The UI Coverage [Results API](/ui-coverage/results-api) allows you to programmatically fetch UI Coverage data for integration into your CI/CD pipeline.
