# Monitor changes

Monitoring changes to your UI Coverage scores over time ensures that regressions are identified and addressed before they are merged. Cypress UI Coverage provides tools to track these changes, enabling proactive quality assurance in your development workflow.

## Automate monitoring with the Results API

The UI Coverage [Results API](/ui-coverage/results-api) allows you to programmatically fetch UI Coverage data for integration into your CI/CD pipeline.

## Deep dive on changes with Branch Review

[Branch Review for UI Coverage](/ui-coverage/core-concepts/compare-reports) allows you to compare any two runs in detail and review new untested elements and links, as well as all new interactive elements added to the application.

## Spot trends overtime with cross-project analytics

In the [Enterprise Reporting](/cloud/features/analytics/enterprise-reporting#UI-Coverage) area of Cypress Cloud, you can view high-level trends across all projects and runs, as well as download reports or retrieve details with an API.
