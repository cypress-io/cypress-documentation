# Troubleshooting

## A single element appears as multiple elements

When a single element is identified as multiple distinct elements in UI Coverage, it may indicate an issue with [Element Identification](/ui-coverage/core-concepts/element-identification). This often occurs due to:

- Auto-generated or dynamic attributes (e.g., UUIDs) that differ across snapshots.
- Library-specific identifiers, such as id attributes generated by frameworks.

### Solutions

- **Add Unique Identifiers**: Assign a stable identifier like `data-cy` or `data-test` to the element.
- **Ignore Dynamic Attributes**: Use [`attributeFilters`](/ui-coverage/configuration/attributefilters) to exclude attributes that change across tests.
- **Manually Configure Identification**: Use [elements](/ui-coverage/configuration/elements) configuration to explicitly define how the element should be identified.

## Multiple different elements are identified as the same

If different elements are being grouped as one in UI Coverage, this could be due to insufficient or non-specific identifiers, such as:

- Missing unique `data-*` or `id` attributes.
- Generic identifiers like `data-test="button"` shared across multiple elements.
- Use of attributes not prioritized by UI Coverage, like `aria-label`.

### Solutions

- **Add unique identifiers**: Assign distinct identifiers like `data-cy` or `data-test` values to each element.
- **Filter generic attributes**: Exclude unrepresentative attributes using [`attributeFilters`](/ui-coverage/configuration/attributefilters) configuration.
- **Customize attribute use**: Update [`significantAttributes`](/ui-coverage/configuration/significantattributes) configuration to prioritize relevant identifiers.
- **Manually Identify Elements**: Use [elements](/ui-coverage/configuration/elements) configuration to specify how elements should be identified.

## Similar elements are not grouped together

If elements performing the same action are not [grouped](/ui-coverage/core-concepts/element-grouping), it may be due to:

- Library-specific identifiers, like dynamic `id` values, are not representative of the element and prevent grouping.
- Identifiers that include dynamic data, such as UUID's

### Solutions

- **Use Shared Identifiers**: Apply consistent `data-cy` or `data-test` values across similar elements.
- **Ignore Dynamic Attributes**: Configure [`attributeFilters`](/ui-coverage/configuration/attributefilters) to exclude varying attributes.
- **Manually Group Elements**: Use [`elementGroups`](/ui-coverage/configuration/elementgroups) configuration to define custom groupings.

## Different elements are incorrectly grouped together

If unrelated elements are [grouped](/ui-coverage/core-concepts/element-grouping), it may be due to overly generic identifiers or shared attributes. Some common examples of this include:

- Missing unique attributes that could distinguish the elements.
- Generic values like `data-test="button"` shared across different elements.

### Solutions

- **Add Distinct Identifiers**: Use unique `data-cy` or `data-test` values for each element.
- **Filter Shared Attributes**: Exclude generic identifiers with [`attributeFilters`](/ui-coverage/configuration/attributefilters) configuration.
- **Update Identification Rules**: Adjust [`significantAttributes`](/ui-coverage/configuration/significantattributes) configuration to improve differentiation.
- **Manually Separate Groups**: Define individual groups using [`elementGroups`](/ui-coverage/configuration/elementgroups) configuration.
