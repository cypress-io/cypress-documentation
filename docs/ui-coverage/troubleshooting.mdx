# Troubleshooting

## A single element is showing up as multiple different elements

If a single element is being identified as multiple different elements by UI Coverage and therefore shows up as many different elements, then you likely have a problem
with [Element Identification](/ui-coverage/core-concepts/element-identification).

If elements have auto-generated or otherwise unrepresentative attributes that are used as identifiers, then that attribute may have one value in one snapshot and a different value in another snapshot, which leads to UI Coverage considering those two different elements.

Some common examples of this include:

- Library-specific identifiers, such as `id` attributes with values that are library-generated and are not representative of the element
- Identifiers that include dynamic data, such as UUID's

To resolve this problem, you can do one of the following:

1. Add a unique identifier to the interactive element, such as a representative `data-cy` or `data-test` value
2. Ignore auto-generated or dynamic attributes using [attributeFilters](/ui-coverage/configuration/attributefilters) configuration
3. Manually identify the element using [elements](/ui-coverage/configuration/elements) configuration

## Multiple different elements are being considered the same element

If multiple different elements are being identified as the same element by UI Coverage and therefore only show up as one element, then you likely have a problem with [Element Identification](/ui-coverage/core-concepts/element-identification).

If elements do not have accurate identifiers, such as unique `data-cy` or `data-test` values, then UI Coverage may treat different elements as a single element due to the similarity of their DOM structure and attributes.

Some common examples of this include:

- Missing `data-*` or `id` values that would otherwise identify the elements
- Generic identifiers, such as `data-test="button"`, used on many different elements
- The use of identifiers that are not used by UI Coverage by default, such as `aria-label`

To resolve this problem, you can do one of the following:

1. Add a unique identifier to the interactive elements, such as representative `data-cy` or `data-test` values
2. Ignore generic and unrepresentative attributes using [attributeFilters](/ui-coverage/configuration/attributefilters) configuration
3. Update the attributes used by UI Coverage for identification using
   [significantAttributes](/ui-coverage/configuration/significantattributes) configuration
4. Manually identify the elements using [elements](/ui-coverage/configuration/elements) configuration

## Elements that perform the same action are not being grouped together but should be

If elements that perform the same action are not being grouped together, then you likely have a problem
with [Element Grouping](/ui-coverage/core-concepts/element-grouping).

If repeated elements have unique attributes that are used as identifiers, then UI Coverage may not group the elements together due to their lack of similarity.

Some common examples of this include:

- Library-specific identifiers, such as `id` attributes with values that are library-generated and are not representative of the element
- Identifiers that include dynamic data, such as UUID's

To resolve this problem, you can do one of the following:

1. Add a shared identifier to the repeated elements, such as the same `data-cy` or `data-test` value
2. Ignore auto-generated or dynamic attributes using [attributeFilters](/ui-coverage/configuration/attributefilters) configuration
3. Manually group the elements using [elementGroups](/ui-coverage/configuration/elementgroups) configuration

## Elements that perform different actions are being grouped together but should not be

If elements that perform different actions are being incorrectly grouped together, then you likely have a problem with [Element Grouping](/ui-coverage/core-concepts/element-grouping).

If repeated elements have shared attributes, such as the same `data-cy` or `data-test` values, then UI Coverage may group the elements together due to the similarity of their DOM structure and attributes.

Some common examples of this include:

- Missing `data-*` or `id` values that would otherwise identify the elements
- Generic identifiers, such as `data-test="button"`, used on many different elements
- The use of identifiers that are not used by UI Coverage by default, such as `aria-label`

To resolve this problem, you can do one of the following:

1. Add a unique identifier to the interactive elements, such as representative `data-cy` or `data-test` values
2. Ignore generic and unrepresentative attributes using [attributeFilters](/ui-coverage/configuration/attributefilters) configuration
3. Update the attributes used by UI Coverage for identification using [significantAttributes](/ui-coverage/configuration/significantattributes) configuration
4. Manually group the elements into their own groups using [elementGroups](/ui-coverage/configuration/elementgroups) configuration
