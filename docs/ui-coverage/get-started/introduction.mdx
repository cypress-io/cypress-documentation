# UI Coverage

<UICovAddon />

## What is UI Coverage

UI Coverage is a visual test coverage report based on the interactive elements that make up your application. It highlights areas of missed test coverage directly within every page of your application, that you can use to make data-driven testing decisions. UI Coverage gives you the tools you need to understand coverage gaps, inform your testing strategy, and ship high-quality code with confidence.

## How it Works

UI Coverage creates a dynamic visual map of test coverage across every page of your application. Each interactive element is identified and highlighted as either tested or untested, providing a clear and actionable overview of your test coverage.

UI Coverage captures "snapshots" of every page visited by your Cypress tests (and every component mounted in Component Testing). Snapshots represent all of the unique states found across your test run, and these states are analyzed to identify all of the unique elements that make up your application.

As a result, a UI Coverage score is generated. This score quantifies coverage across your application by measuring the ratio of the unique elements that have been tested to the total unique elements that are found across your application.

## Getting Started

To access UI Coverage, navigate to the 'UI Coverage' tab in a run's details page. You can access a run's details page by clicking on a run in the 'Latest runs' tab.
