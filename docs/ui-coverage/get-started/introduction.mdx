# Identify testing gaps with UI Coverage

Easily track, monitor, and visualize the test coverage of your UI to prevent regressions by ensuring critical flows of your app are tested. Save CI resources by removing redundant tests and improve your team's productivity with a visual overview of UI coverage across every page and component.

## Get Started

UI Coverage works instantly, with no setup or code instrumentation required. If you record test runs to the Cypress Cloud with Test Replay, you're ready to start using UI Coverage.
You'll start your free trial with personalized support from our sales team and your existing test data to instantly see where testing gaps exist for all of your Cypress projects.
From there, you can easily customize reports to fit your needs with flexible configuration options.

## How it Works

UI Coverage provides an interactive, visual map of test coverage for your application, powered by Cypress [Test Replay](/cloud/features/test-replay) (requires Cypress v13+). These reports are automatically generated for every unique state reached during your Cypress tests, whether in end-to-end or component testing.

- **Effortless Setup**: No extra configuration is required. UI Coverage uses the same capture protocol as Test Replay, so no additional code or configuration is needed.
- **Dynamic Coverage Mapping**: Each interactive element is identified and highlighted as tested or untested, giving you a clear view of your test coverage across all pages and components.
- **DOM Snapshots**: Each tested and untested element is accompanied by a full-page, inspectable DOM snapshot, highlighting the exact location and context of element.
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: A UI Coverage score is calculated by comparing tested elements to the total interactable elements in your application.
- **Actionable Reports**: Sortable and filterable views provide insights into which areas are tested and which need improvement.
- **Flexible configuration**: Customize and fine-tune UI Coverage to suit specific needs and scenarios like ignoring views or elements or grouping similar elements together.
- **Configurable CI Integration**: The [Results API](/ui-coverage/results-api) allows you to programmatically control your CI pipeline's behavior based on UI Coverage scores.
