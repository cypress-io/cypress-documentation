## Framework Configuration

Cypress Component Testing works out of the box with
[Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/), [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/),
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and a custom [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
config. Cypress will automatically detect one of these frameworks during setup
and configure them properly. The examples below are for reference purposes.

### Vue CLI

Cypress Component Testing works with Vue CLI.

#### Vue CLI Configuration

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
{
  component: {
    devServer: {
      framework: 'vue-cli',
      bundler: 'webpack',
    },
  },
}
```

:::

:::caution

<strong class="alert-header">PWA Caveat</strong>

If you use the Vue CLI's PWA feature, there is a known caveat regarding
configuration. See
[here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15968#issuecomment-819170918)
for more information.

:::

#### Sample Vue CLI Apps

- [Vue 3 CLI 5 with TypeScript](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps/tree/main/vue3-cli5-ts)
- [Vue 2 CLI 4 with JavaScript](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps/tree/main/vue2-cli4-js)

### Nuxt

Cypress Component Testing works with Nuxt 2. Nuxt 3 is not yet supported.

:::caution

Nuxt is currently in alpha support for component testing.

:::

#### Nuxt Configuration

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
{
  component: {
    devServer: {
      framework: 'nuxt',
      bundler: 'webpack',
    },
  },
}
```

:::

#### Nuxt Sample Apps

- [Vue 2 Nuxt 2 with JavaScript](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps/tree/main/vue2-nuxt2-js)

### Vue with Vite

Cypress Component Testing works with Vue apps that use Vite 2+ as the bundler.

#### Vite Configuration

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
{
  component: {
    devServer: {
      framework: 'vue',
      bundler: 'vite',
    },
  },
}
```

:::

#### Vue Vite Sample Apps

- [Vue 3 Vite with TypeScript](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps/tree/main/vue3-vite-ts)

### Vue with Webpack

Cypress Component Testing works with Vue apps that use Webpack 4+ as the
bundler.

#### Webpack Configuration

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
import webpackConfig from './webpack.config'
```

```ts
{
  component: {
    devServer: {
      framework: 'vue',
      bundler: 'webpack',
      // optionally pass in webpack config
      webpackConfig,
      webpackConfig: async () => {
        // ... do things ...
        const modifiedConfig = await injectCustomConfig(baseConfig)
        return modifiedConfig
      },
    },
  },
}
```

:::

If you don't provide one, Cypress will try to infer your webpack config. If
Cypress cannot or you want to make modifications to your config, you can pass it
in manually via the `webpackConfig` option.

#### Vue Webpack Sample Apps

- [Vue 3 Webpack 5 with TypeScript](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps/tree/main/vue3-webpack-ts)
