Cypress Component Testing provides a component workbench for you to quickly
build and test components from multiple front-end UI libraries â€” no matter how
simple or complex.

## Quick Example

Below is a minimal test to assert that a button component has the correct text:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="React">

```ts
import Button from './Button'

it('uses custom text for the button label', () => {
  cy.mount(<Button>Click me!</Button>)
  cy.get('button').should('contains.text', 'Click me!')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Angular">

```ts
import ButtonComponent from './button.component'

it('uses custom text for the button label', () => {
  cy.mount('<app-button>Click me!</app-button>', {
    declarations: [ButtonComponent],
  })
  cy.get('button').should('contains.text', 'Click me!')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Vue">

```ts
import Button from './Button.vue'

it('uses custom text for the button label', () => {
  cy.mount(Button, {
    slots: {
      default: 'Click me!',
    },
  })
  cy.get('button').should('contains.text', 'Click me!')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Svelte">

```ts
import Button from './Button.svelte'

it('uses custom text for the button label', () => {
  cy.mount(Button, { props: { msg: 'Click me!' } })
  cy.get('button').should('contains.text', 'Click me!')
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Why Cypress Component Testing?

Our Test Runner is browser-based, allowing you to test not only your component's
functionality but also styles and appearance. You can visually see your
component in action and interact with it in the test runner:

<DocsVideo
  src="/img/guides/component-testing/vuetify-color-picker-example.webm"
  caption="Vuetify's</a> VColorPicker tests, after being moved to Cypress from Jest."
/>

You can use the browser developer tools to inspect the DOM, play around with
styles, and use the debugger to step through your code.

And since this is Cypress, you get the same APIs, plugins, and ecosystem you are
used to with end-to-end testing to create component tests.

## Component Testing vs. End-to-End Testing

We cover the differences between component and end-to-end testing in-depth in
the [Choosing a Testing Type](/guides/core-concepts/testing-types) guide.

But in short, Cypress Component Testing uses the same test runner, commands, and
API to test components instead of pages.

The primary difference is that Cypress Component Testing builds your components
using a development server instead of rendering within a complete website, which
results in faster tests and fewer dependencies on infrastructure than end-to-end
tests covering the same code paths.

Cypress's API is user-centric and built for testing anything that renders on the
web. Therefore, many of your tests will appear framework-agnostic and
**approachable for developers coming from any background**.

For additional reading, we encourage folks to check out the
[Component Driven](https://componentdriven.org) organization, which talks about
the pros of component-driven development and may aid you when trying to figure
out if you should be taking a page-based or component-based approach to building
and testing a given feature.
