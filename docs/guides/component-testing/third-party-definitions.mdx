# Integrating with Cypress Component Testing

:::info
This feature is only available in Cypress 12.7 and later.
:::


Cypress Component Testing includes [official support](/guides/component-testing/overview#Supported-Frameworks) for many popular libraries and frameworks such as [React](/guides/component-testing/react/overview), [Angular](/guides/component-testing/angular/overview), and [Vue](/guides/component-testing/vue/overview). All officially supported libraries feature a first class onboarding experience, where we detect and scaffold the correct files, and a framework-specific `mount` adapter to render your components. We call this collection of features a *Framework Definition* since it defines the requirements for a library or framework to work in Cypress.

If your favorite library isn't featured, don't worry - we expose the same API we use internally for the Cypress community to define their own Framework Definitions.

In this guide, you'll learn how to author a Framework Definition, which will enjoy the same polished onboarding experience as our officially supported frameworks.

## Concepts

There are a few requirements for authoring a Framework Definition.

- [Definition File](#Framework-Definition) (we recommending naming this `definition.cjs`)
- [Mount Adapter](#Mount-Adapter) (we recommending naming this `index.mjs`)
- A [`package.json`](#packagejson) with the correct conventions

The Definition is required when users configure Component Testing for the first time. The Mount adapter is used to render components when writing tests.

To simplify this process, we recommend starting development using [our official template](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-ct-definition-template).

## Framework Definition

Below is a minimal Framework Definition. Note that `defineFrameworkDefinition` is purely for type safety, similar to `defineConfig` in `cypress.config`.

There is one important convention; the `type` key in `defineFrameworkDefinition` should match the name of your package on npm, and should be named using one of the following conventions:

- `cypress-ct-*` 
- `@organization/cypress-ct-*` 

Some examples of valid names include:

- `cypress-ct-react-js`
- `cypress-ct-svelte-testing`
- `@cypress/cypress-ct-react`
- `@angular/cypress-ct-angular`

When configuring a project to use Component Testing, Cypress will load any dependencies following this naming convention from the project's `node_modules` and present them as framework options.

A simple example of a Framework Defintion for the [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) library is shown below. We generally recommend naming this `definition.cjs`. In our [official template](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-ct-definition-template), this file is at the root level of the package.

```js
const { defineFrameworkDefinition } = require("cypress");

const solidDep = {
  // Unique, semantic identifier.
  type: "solid-js",

  // Human readable name.
  name: "Solid",

  // Package name install from `npm`.
  package: "solid-js",

  /**
   * Similar to package, but can include a version or tag.
   * Used during setup to generate an install command for users.
   * Eg: `solid-js@next`
   */
  installer: "solid-js",

  // Human readable description.
  description:
    "A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.",

  // Minimum supported version.
  minVersion: "^1.6.0",
};

/**
 * Similar to above. Create an smooth, seamless setup experience
 * by ensuring the user has all the necessary dependencies.
 * @type {Cypress.CypressComponentDependency}
 */
const solidVitePlugin = {
  type: "solid-js-vite-plugin",
  name: "Vite Plugin Solid",
  package: "vite-plugin-solid",
  installer: "vite-plugin-solid",
  description: "A simple integration to run solid-js with vite",
  minVersion: "^1.6.0 || ^2.0.0",
};

/**
 * The actual definition.
 */
module.exports = defineFrameworkDefinition({
  /**
   * This should match the `npm` package name.
   * The convention required to ensure your Definition is processed
   * by Cypress is `cypress-ct-*` for global packages, or
   * `@org/cypress-ct-*` for organization level packages.
   */
  type: "@lmiller1990/cypress-ct-solid-js",

  /**
   * The label that shows up when configuring Component Testing
   * for the first time.
   */
  name: "Solid.js",

  /**
   * Supported bundlers. Can be "webpack" and/or "vite".
   * In this example we only support Solid.js with Vite.
   */
  supportedBundlers: ["vite"],

  /**
   * Used by Cypress to automatically detect the correct Framework Definition
   * based on the user's project.
   * In this example, if a module matching `solidDep`
   * is found in the user's project,
   * Solid.js will automatically be selected when configuring Component Testing.
   */
  detectors: [solidDep],

  /**
    * Supply a set of dependencies a project should have to use this Framework Definition. The user will be prompted to install them if they are not found.
   * Optionally, supply different dependencies based on the chosen bundler.
   */
  dependencies: (bundler) => {
    return [solidDep, solidVitePlugin];
  },

Our Framework Definition shows up in Cypress! It has the "community" label, indicating it's a third party definition.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/component-testing/framework-definition-1.png"
  alt="custom framework definition"
/>

We defined the `dependencies`, which are also correctly handled - we haven't installed them all, so Cypress is prompting us to do so:


<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/component-testing/framework-definition-2.png"
  alt="required dependencies"
/>

## Mount Adapter

The second part of defining a Framework Definition is the Mount Adapter. This is the function that renders the component in your tests using `cy.mount()`. 

By default, Cypress will look for this as a `mount` function that is a **named export** from the package. This should be written in a `index.mjs` file. This example is for a [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) mount adapter:

```js
import { getContainerEl, setupHooks } from "@cypress/mount-utils";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";

let dispose;

function cleanup() {
  dispose?.();
}

/**
 * @param {() => JSX.Element} - component to render
 */
export function mount(component, options = {}) {
  // Retrieve root DOM element that Cypress has prepared for this test
  const root = getContainerEl();

  dispose = render(() => component, root);

  // Wait until next microtick to ensure any async render logic has executed
  return cy.wait(0, { log: false }).then(() => {
    if (options.log) {
      Cypress.log({
        name: "mount",
        message: "Mounted component",
      });
    }
  });
}

// Cleanup between each test
setupHooks(cleanup);
```

This is different for each library, but the concept is the same - identify how to mount or render a component in your library, and implement it in a function named `mount` in `index.mjs`.

When a user configures Component Testing with your Framework Definition we automatically configure a `cy.mount` command using your `mount` function in the Component Testing `supportFile`:

```js
import { mount } from '@lmiller1990/cypress-ct-solid-js'

Cypress.Commands.add('mount', mount)
```

## package.json

The final thing you need is a correctly configured `package.json`. This example was created using [our official template](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-ct-definition-template).

There are two fields of note:
* `name`: Your package name which must follow the `cypress-ct-*`/`@org/cypress-ct-*` convention
* `exports`: Object referencing the two files we created to comprise the Framework Definition. The `node` entry points to the Definition file, and the `default` entry points to the Mount Adapter:

```json {2,5-8}
{
  "name": "@lmiller1990/cypress-ct-solid-js",
  "version": "0.0.4",
  "description": "Example Framework Definition for Cypress and Solid.js",
  "exports": {
    "node": "./definition.cjs",
    "default": "./index.mjs"
  },
  "files": [
    "package.json",
    "definition.cjs",
    "index.mjs"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "@cypress/mount-utils": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "solid-js": "^1.6.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "solid-js": "^1.6.0"
    "cypress": "^12.7.0"
  }
}
```

## Publishing on npm

That's it! Publish your Framework Definition on npm and start using it.

## List of Framework Definitions

Once your Framework Definition is published and ready for use we would be delighted to mention it in our documentation so other Cypress users on the same framework can find it. [Submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
