## Framework Configuration

Cypress Component Testing works out of the box with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/),
and a custom [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) config. Cypress will
automatically detect one of these frameworks during setup and configure them
properly. The examples below are for reference purposes.

### Svelte with Vite

Cypress Component Testing works with Svelte apps that use Vite 2+ as the
bundler.

#### Vite Configuration

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
{
  component: {
    devServer: {
      framework: 'svelte',
      bundler: 'vite',
    },
  },
}
```

#### Svelte Vite Sample Apps

- [Svelte 3 Vite 3 with Typescript](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-testing-apps/tree/main/svelte-vite-ts)

### Svelte with Webpack

Cypress Component Testing works with Vue apps that use Webpack 4+ as the
bundler.

#### Webpack Configuration

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
import webpackConfig from './webpack.config'
```

```ts
{
  component: {
    devServer: {
      framework: 'svelte',
      bundler: 'webpack',
      // optionally pass in webpack config
      webpackConfig,
    },
  },
}
```

:::

If you don't provide one, Cypress will try to infer your webpack config. If
Cypress cannot or you want to make modifications to your config, you can pass it
in manually via the `webpackConfig` option.

#### Svelte Webpack Sample Apps
