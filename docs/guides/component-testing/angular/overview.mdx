## Framework Support

Cypress Component Testing supports Angular 13+.

## Tutorial

Visit the
[Angular Quickstart Guide](/guides/component-testing/angular/quickstart) for a
step-by-step tutorial.

## Installation

To get up and running with Cypress Component Testing in Angular, install Cypress
into your project:

```bash
npm i cypress -D
```

Open Cypress:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

The Cypress Launchpad will guide you through configuring your project.

For a step-by-step guide through the installation wizard, refer to the
[Configure Component Testing](/guides/component-testing/angular/quickstart#Configuring-Component-Testing)
section of the Angular quickstart guide.

## Usage

### What is the Mount Function?

We ship a `mount` function that is imported from the `cypress` package. It is
responsible for rendering components within Cypress's sandboxed iframe and
handling any framework-specific cleanup.

```ts
import { mount } from 'cypress/angular'
```

While you can use the `mount` function in your tests, we recommend using
[`cy.mount()`](/api/commands/mount), which is added as a
[custom command](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands) in the
**cypress/support/component.ts** file:

```ts title=cypress/support/component.ts
import { mount } from 'cypress/angular'

Cypress.Commands.add('mount', mount)
```

This allows you to use `cy.mount()` in any component test without having to
import the framework-specific mount command, as well as customizing it to fit
your needs. For more info, visit the
[Custom Mount Commands](/guides/component-testing/angular/examples#Custom-Mount-Commands)
section in the Angular examples.

### Using `cy.mount()`

To mount a component with `cy.mount()`, import the component and pass it to the
method:

```ts
import { StepperComponent } from './stepper.component'

it('mounts', () => {
  cy.mount(StepperComponent)
})
```

### Passing Data to a Component

You can pass inputs and outputs to a component by setting
[componentProperties](/guides/component-testing/angular/api#ComponentProperties)
in the options:

```ts
cy.mount(StepperComponent, {
  componentProperties: {
    count: 100,
    change: new EventEmitter(),
  },
})
```

### Imports/Declarations/Providers

If you need to set up any additional `imports`, `declarations`, or `providers`
for your component to mount successfully, you can set them in the options
(similar to using an `ngModule`):

```ts
cy.mount(ComponentThatFetchesData, {
  imports: [HttpClientModule],
  declarations: [ButtonComponent],
  providers: [DataService],
})
```

View the
[Default Declarations, Providers, or Imports](/guides/component-testing/angular/examples#Default-Declarations-Providers-or-Imports)
to set up common options in a custom `cy.mount()` command so these don't have to
be repeated for each test.

### Using Angular Template Syntax

The `cy.mount()` method also supports the Angular template syntax when mounting
a component. Some developers might prefer this approach to the object based
mount style:

```ts
cy.mount(`<app-stepper [count]="100"></app-stepper>`, {
  declarations: [StepperComponent],
})
```

> When using template syntax, the component needs to added to the declarations
> in the options parameter.

Using with event emitter spy:

```ts
cy.mount('<app-button (click)="onClick.emit($event)">Click me</app-button>', {
  declarations: [ButtonComponent]
  componentProperties: {
    onClick: createOutputSpy('onClickSpy'),
  },
})
cy.get('button').click();
cy.get('@onClickSpy').should('have.been.called');
```

### Accessing the Component Instance

There might be times when you might want to access the component instance
directly in your tests. To do so, use `.then()`, which enables us to work with
the subject that was yielded from the `cy.mount()` command. In this case, mount
yields an object that contains the rendered component and the fixture.

In the below example, we use the component to spy directly on the `change` event
emitter.

```ts
it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  cy.mount(
    '<app-stepper count="100" (change)="change.emit($event)"></app-stepper>',
    {
      componentProperties: { change: new EventEmitter() },
      declarations: [StepperComponent],
    }
  ).then((wrapper) => {
    console.log({ wrapper })
    cy.spy(wrapper.component.change, 'emit').as('changeSpy')
    return cy.wrap(wrapper).as('angular')
  })
  cy.get(incrementSelector).click()
  cy.get('@changeSpy').should('have.been.calledWith', 101)
})
```

### Using createOutputSpy()

To make spying on event emitters easier, there is a utility function called
`createOutputSpy()` which can be used to automatically create an `EventEmitter`
and setup the spy on it's `.emit()` method. It can be used like the following:

```ts
import { createOutputSpy } from 'cypress/angular'

it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  // Arrange
  cy.mount('<app-stepper (change)="change.emit($event)"></app-stepper>', {
    declarations: [StepperComponent],
    componentProperties: {
      change: createOutputSpy<boolean>('changeSpy'),
    },
  })
  cy.get(incrementSelector).click()
  cy.get('@changeSpy').should('have.been.called')
})
```

### Using autoSpyOutputs

You might find yourself repeatedly creating a `cy.spy()` for each of your
component outputs. Because of this, we created an easy mechanism to handle this
for you. This feature can be turned on by passing the `autoSpyOutputs` flag into
`MountConfig`. After the component has been mounted you can then access each of
the generated spies using the `@Output()` property name + `Spy`. So our `change`
property can be accessed via its alias of `cy.get('@changeSpy')`

```ts
it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  cy.mount(StepperComponent, {
    autoSpyOutputs: true,
    componentProperties: {
      count: 100,
    },
  })
  cy.get(incrementSelector).click()
  cy.get('@changeSpy').should('have.been.calledWith', 101)
})
```

:::caution

The `autoSpyOutput` flag only works when passing in a component to the mount
function. It currently does not work with the template syntax.

:::

:::caution

`autoSpyOutput` is an **experimental feature** and could be removed or changed
in the future.

## Framework Configuration

Cypress Component Testing works out of the box with `@angular/cli` projects.
Cypress will automatically detect your project is Angular during setup and
configure it properly. The examples below are for reference purposes.

### Angular CLI Configuration

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
{
  component: {
    devServer: {
      framework: 'angular',
      bundler: 'webpack',
    },
    specPattern: '**/*.cy.ts',
  },
}
```

:::

#### Options API

You can also use the `options` API to provide your own project specific
configuration to your `devServer`. The `devServer` configuration receives an
`options` property:

:::cypress-config-example

```ts title=cypress.config.ts
{
  component: {
    framework: 'angular',
    bundler: 'webpack',
    options: {
      projectConfig: {
        root: '',
        sourceRoot: 'apps/my-app',
        buildOptions: {
          outputPath: 'dist/my-app',
          index: 'apps/my-app/src/index.html',
          main: 'apps/my-app/src/main.ts',
          polyfills: 'apps/my-app/src/polyfills.ts',
          tsConfig: 'apps/my-app/tsconfig.app.json',
          inlineStyleLanguage: 'scss',
          assets: ['apps/my-app/src/favicon.ico', 'apps/my-app/src/assets'],
          styles: ['apps/my-app/src/styles.scss'],
          scripts: [],
          buildOptimizer: false,
          optimization: false,
          vendorChunk: true,
          extractLicenses: false,
          sourceMap: true,
          namedChunks: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```
