## Mounting Components

### Using `cy.mount()`

To mount a component with `cy.mount()`, import the component and pass it to the
method:

```ts
import { StepperComponent } from './stepper.component'

it('mounts', () => {
  cy.mount(StepperComponent)
})
```

### Passing Data to a Component

You can pass inputs and outputs to a component by setting
[componentProperties](/guides/component-testing/angular/api#MountConfig)
in the options:

```ts
cy.mount(StepperComponent, {
  componentProperties: {
    count: 100,
    change: new EventEmitter(),
  },
})
```

### Testing Event Handlers

Pass a Cypress [spy](/guides/guides/stubs-spies-and-clocks#Spies) to an event
prop and validate it was called:

```ts
it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  cy.mount(StepperComponent, {
    componentProperties: {
      change: createOutputSpy('changeSpy'),
    },
  })
  cy.get('[data-cy=increment]').click()
  cy.get('@changeSpy').should('have.been.calledWith', 1)
})
```

### Imports/Declarations/Providers

If you need to set up any additional `imports`, `declarations`, or `providers`
for your component to mount successfully, you can set them in the options
(similar to setting them up in `ngModule` in a app):

```ts
cy.mount(ComponentThatFetchesData, {
  imports: [HttpClientModule],
  declarations: [ButtonComponent],
  providers: [DataService],
})
```

See
[Default Declarations, Providers, or Imports](/guides/component-testing/angular/examples#Default-Declarations-Providers-or-Imports)
to set up common options in a custom `cy.mount()` command to avoid having to
repeat this boilerplate for each test.

### Using Standalone

Not only are [Standalone Components](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components) supported, they are the simplest components to write tests for.
Standalone Components provide the Angular compiler with everything it needs to compile through its [`@Component()`](https://angular.io/api/core/Component) decorator.
This means that in most cases a Standalone Component can be mounted without ever providing any `imports`, `decorators`, or `providers`. Mounting then becomes as simple as:

```ts
cy.mount(MyStandaloneComponent)
```

### Using Angular Template Syntax

The `cy.mount()` method also supports the Angular template syntax when mounting
a component. Some developers might prefer this approach to the object based
mount style:

```ts
cy.mount(`<app-stepper [count]="100"></app-stepper>`, {
  declarations: [StepperComponent],
})
```

> When using template syntax, the component needs to added to the declarations
> in the options parameter.

Using with event emitter spy:

```ts
cy.mount('<app-button (click)="onClick.emit($event)">Click me</app-button>', {
  declarations: [ButtonComponent]
  componentProperties: {
    onClick: createOutputSpy('onClickSpy'),
  },
})
cy.get('button').click();
cy.get('@onClickSpy').should('have.been.called');
```

### Accessing the Component Instance

There might be times when you might want to access the component instance
directly in your tests. To do so, use `.then()`, which enables us to work with
the subject that was yielded from the `cy.mount()` command. In this case, mount
yields an object that contains the rendered component and the fixture.

In the below example, we use the component to spy directly on the `change` event
emitter.

```ts
it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  cy.mount(
    '<app-stepper count="100" (change)="change.emit($event)"></app-stepper>',
    {
      componentProperties: { change: new EventEmitter() },
      declarations: [StepperComponent],
    }
  ).then((wrapper) => {
    console.log({ wrapper })
    cy.spy(wrapper.component.change, 'emit').as('changeSpy')
    return cy.wrap(wrapper).as('angular')
  })
  cy.get(incrementSelector).click()
  cy.get('@changeSpy').should('have.been.calledWith', 101)
})
```

### Using createOutputSpy()

To make spying on event emitters easier, there is a utility function called
`createOutputSpy()` which can be used to automatically create an `EventEmitter`
and setup the spy on it's `.emit()` method. It can be used like the following:

```ts
import { createOutputSpy } from 'cypress/angular'

it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  // Arrange
  cy.mount('<app-stepper (change)="change.emit($event)"></app-stepper>', {
    declarations: [StepperComponent],
    componentProperties: {
      change: createOutputSpy<boolean>('changeSpy'),
    },
  })
  cy.get(incrementSelector).click()
  cy.get('@changeSpy').should('have.been.called')
})
```

### Using autoSpyOutputs

You might find yourself repeatedly creating a `cy.spy()` for each of your
component outputs. Because of this, we created an easy mechanism to handle this
for you. This feature can be turned on by passing the `autoSpyOutputs` flag into
`MountConfig`. After the component has been mounted you can then access each of
the generated spies using the `@Output()` property name + `Spy`. So our `change`
property can be accessed via its alias of `cy.get('@changeSpy')`

```ts
it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  cy.mount(StepperComponent, {
    autoSpyOutputs: true,
    componentProperties: {
      count: 100,
    },
  })
  cy.get(incrementSelector).click()
  cy.get('@changeSpy').should('have.been.calledWith', 101)
})
```

:::caution

The `autoSpyOutput` flag only works when passing in a component to the mount
function. It currently does not work with the template syntax.

:::caution

`autoSpyOutput` is an **experimental feature** and could be removed or changed
in the future

## Custom Mount Commands

### Customizing `cy.mount()`

By default, `cy.mount()` is a simple passthrough to `mount()`, however, you can
customize `cy.mount()` to fit your needs. For instance, you may find yourself
doing repetitive work during mounting. In order to reduce boilerplate you may
find it useful to create a custom mount command.

### Default Declarations, Providers, or Imports

If you find yourself registering a bunch of declarations, providers, or imports
in your individual tests, we recommend doing them all within a custom
`cy.mount()` command. The overhead is usually minimal for all your tests and it
helps keep your spec code clean.

Below is a sample that registers several default component declarations while
still allowing additional ones to be passed in via the config param. The same
pattern can also be applied to providers and module imports.

```ts title=support/component.ts
import { Type } from '@angular/core'
import { mount, MountConfig } from 'cypress/angular'
import { ButtonComponent } from 'src/app/button/button.component'
import { CardComponent } from 'src/app/card/card.component'

declare global {
  namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable {
      mount: typeof customMount
    }
  }
}

const declarations = [ButtonComponent, CardComponent]

function customMount<T>(component: string | Type<T>, config?: MountConfig<T>) {
  if (!config) {
    config = { declarations }
  } else {
    config.declarations = [...(config?.declarations || []), ...declarations]
  }
  return mount<T>(component, config)
}

Cypress.Commands.add('mount', customMount)
```

This custom mount command will allow you to skip manually passing in the
`ButtonComponent` and `CardComponent` as declarations into each `cy.mount()`
call.

### autoSpyOutputs

Here is an example of defaulting `autoSpyOutputs` for every mounted component:

```ts title=support/component.ts
declare global {
  namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable {
      mount: typeof mount
    }
  }
}

Cypress.Commands.add(
  'mount',
  (component: Type<unknown> | string, config: MountConfig<T>) => {
    return mount(component, {
      ...config,
      autoSpyOutputs: true,
    })
  }
)
```

:::caution

The `autoSpyOutput` flag only works when passing in a component to the mount
function. It currently does not work with the template syntax.
