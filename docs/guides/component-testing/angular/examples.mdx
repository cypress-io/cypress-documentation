## Custom Mount Commands

### Customizing `cy.mount()`

By default, `cy.mount()` is a simple passthrough to `mount()`, however, you can
customize `cy.mount()` to fit your needs. For instance, you may find yourself
doing repetitive work during mounting. In order to reduce boilerplate you may
find it useful to create a custom mount command.

### Default Declarations, Providers, or Imports

If you find yourself registering a bunch of declarations, providers, or imports
in your individual tests, we recommend doing them all within a custom
`cy.mount()` command. The overhead is usually minimal for all your tests and it
helps keep your spec code clean.

Below is a sample that registers several default component declarations while
still allowing additional ones to be passed in via the config param. The same
pattern can also be applied to providers and module imports.

```ts title=support/component.ts
import { Type } from '@angular/core'
import { mount, MountConfig } from 'cypress/angular'
import { ButtonComponent } from 'src/app/button/button.component'
import { CardComponent } from 'src/app/card/card.component'

declare global {
  namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable {
      mount: typeof customMount
    }
  }
}

const declarations = [ButtonComponent, CardComponent]

function customMount<T>(component: string | Type<T>, config?: MountConfig<T>) {
  if (!config) {
    config = { declarations }
  } else {
    config.declarations = [...(config?.declarations || []), ...declarations]
  }
  return mount<T>(component, config)
}

Cypress.Commands.add('mount', customMount)
```

This custom mount command will allow you to skip manually passing in the
`ButtonComponent` and `CardComponent` as declarations into each `cy.mount()`
call.

### autoSpyOutputs

Here is an example of defaulting `autoSpyOutputs` for every mounted component:

```ts title=support/component.ts
declare global {
  namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable {
      mount: typeof mount
    }
  }
}

Cypress.Commands.add(
  'mount',
  (component: Type<unknown> | string, config: MountConfig<T>) => {
    return mount(component, {
      ...config,
      autoSpyOutputs: true,
    })
  }
)
```

:::caution

The `autoSpyOutput` flag only works when passing in a component to the mount
function. It currently does not work with the template syntax.
