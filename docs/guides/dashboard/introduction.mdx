# Dashboard

The [Cypress Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) is a service that gives
you access to recorded test results - typically when running Cypress tests from
your [CI provider](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction). The Dashboard
provides you insight into what happened when your tests ran.

over 300 test cases in parallel across 25 machines, multiple browsers, multiple
device sizes, and multiple operating systems.
