## 12.0.0

_Released 12/06/2022_

**Summary:**

The Session and Origin Experiment is now generally available for end-to-end
testing. This means Cypress now fully supports:

- Testing multiple origins in a single test with the new
  [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) command.
- Caching and restoring cookies,
  [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage),
  and
  [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
  between tests
- Configuring
  [`testIsolation`](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation)
  in suites to define whether or not the browser context is cleaned or persisted
  between tests

Additionally in this release, enhancements were made to how Cypress manages DOM
element resolution to reduce the likelihood of hitting detached DOM errors due
to maintaining stale DOM references. We've updated our
[Retry-ability Guide](/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability) with all the details
if you'd like to learn more.

**Breaking Changes:**

- Cypress dropped support for Node.js 12, 15 and 17. Those versions have reached
  end-of-life. Installing Cypress on your system now requires Node.js 14, 16 or
  18+. Addressed in [#24885](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24885).
- Cypress has always recommended writing tests in a clean context. In Cypress
  12, we enforce running tests in a clean browser context through
  [test isolation](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation).
  This option is configurable, but is enabled by default. Whether enabled or
  disabled, this changes how Cypress cleans up the browser context before each
  test and you may experience test errors with this upgrade. To better
  understand the full impact of this change, please review the
  [migration guide](/guides/references/migration-guide#test-isolation).
  - In Cypress v12, the `testIsolation` configuration values have changed from
    `on` or `off` to `true` or `false`. Addressed in
    [#24935](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24935).
- The `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` configuration option has been removed and
  all functionality associated with this experiment is now enabled by default,
  with the exception of using `require` and `import` with callback supplied to
  the [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) command. To leverage external
  dependencies in `cy.origin()` callbacks, set the new
  [`e2e.experimentalOriginDependencies`](/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing)
  configuration option to `true`. Addresses
  [#21471](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21471).
- The `Cookies.defaults` and `Cookies.preserveOnce` APIs have been removed. Use
  the new [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) command to preserve cookies
  between tests. Addresses
  [#21472](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21472).
- The `cy.server()` and `cy.route()` commands have been removed. Additionally,
  the corresponding `Cypress.Server.defaults` API has also been removed. Use the
  [`cy.intercept()`](/api/commands/intercept) command to stub network responses
  and requests. Addresses
  [#22126](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22126).
- The Cookie commands now uses the `hostname` as the domain by default instead
  of the `superdomain`. This change aligns Cypress' cookie rules with the
  browser cookie rules. This may affect what cookies are returned by
  [`cy.getCookie()`](/api/commands/getcookie), what cookies are set with
  [`cy.setCookie()`](/api/commands/setcookie), and the cookies cleared with
  [`cy.clearCookies()`](/api/commands/clearcookies). Addresses
  [#363](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/363),
  [#5723](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5723) and
  [#24526](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24526).
- The [`.within()`](/api/commands/within) command now requires a single subject
  and throws an error if given more than one subject. This change adds
  consistency around how `.within()` behaves across commands. Previously some
  commands inside a `.within()` callback would silently select the first
  element, while others would use all of the previously yielded subjects, and
  others would throw an error. Addressed in
  [#24975](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24975).
- Cypress now throws an error if any Cypress commands are invoked from inside a
  [`.should()`](/api/commands/should) callback. This previously resulted in
  unusual and undefined behavior. Addresses
  [#5963](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5963),
  [#14656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14656) and
  [#22587](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22587).
- The [`.invoke()`](/api/commands/invoke) command now throws an error if the
  invoked function returns a promise. If you wish to call a method that returns
  a promise and wait for it to resolve, use [`.then()`](/api/commands/then)
  instead of `.invoke()`. Addressed in
  [#24417](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24417).
- The [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) command now uses
  [`querystringify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/querystringify) to stringify
  & parse the `qs` options. This change aligns with how the
  [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) command generates urls with query
  parameters. Addressed in
  [#20302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20302).
- Aliases created with `.as()` now re-run queries leading up to them. To opt in
  to the old behavior, where aliases are static once defined, use
  `.as('aliasName', { type: 'value' })`, introduced in Cypress [12.3.0](#12-3-0).

**Features:**

- Added a new configuration option called `testIsolation`, which defaults to
  `true`. This option can be set at the `e2e` or suite-level to determine
  whether or not
  [test isolation](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation)
  is enabled to ensure a clean browser context between tests. Addressed in
  [#22230](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/22230).
- The previously experimental Cypress command,
  [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin), is now generally available in
  end-to-end testing. This command allows testing multiple origins in a single
  test. Addresses [#17336](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17336).
- The previously experimental Cypress command,
  [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session), is now generally available. This
  command caches and restores `cookies`,
  [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage),
  and
  [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
  in order to recreate a consistent browser context between tests. Addresses
  [#20977](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20977).
- Added a new Cypress command,
  [`cy.getAllLocalStorage()`](/api/commands/getalllocalstorage), to get
  [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
  data for all origins with which the test has interacted. Addresses
  [#24276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24276).
- Added a new Cypress command,
  [`cy.clearAllLocalStorage()`](/api/commands/clearalllocalstorage), to clear
  [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
  data for all origins with which the test has interacted. Addresses
  [#24276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24276).
- Added a new Cypress command,
  [`cy.getAllSessionStorage()`](/api/commands/getallsessionstorage), to get
  [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
  data for all origins with which the test has interacted. Addresses
  [#24276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24276).
- Added a new Cypress command,
  [`cy.clearAllSessionStorage()`](/api/commands/clearallsessionstorage), to
  clear
  [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
  data for all origins with which the test has interacted. Addresses
  [#24276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24276).
- Added a new configuration option called
  [`experimentalOriginDependencies`](/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing),
  which defaults to `false`. This option enables support for `require` and
  `import` within the callback supplied to the
  [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) command in end-to-end testing.
  Previously this feature was enabled through the `experimentalSessionAndOrigin`
  configuration option. `experimentalOriginDependencies` was added as a
  configuration option in Cypress 12, instead of being enabled by default, due
  to increased Node.js memory usage associated with this option that needs to be
  addressed before making this behavior generally available. See issue
  [#24976](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24976) for more
  information. Addressed in
  [#24931](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24931).
- Added a new `Cypress.ensure` API which provides several methods that can be
  helpful when writing customs commands. Addressed in
  [#24697](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24697).
- Added a new "Run All" button to the
  [`experimentalRunAllSpecs`](/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing)
  experiment which enables running all spec files returned from the
  `specPattern` glob or an array of globs, regardless of the specs sharing a
  root folder. Addresses
  [#24759](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24759).
- Further improved bundling in the binary to reduce startup and unzip time.
  Addressed in [#24909](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24909)

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in [10.11.0](#10-11-0) where the Launchpad no longer showed
  a loading spinner on startup to indicate that it had successfully started and
  was in a loading state. Fixed
  [#24950](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24950).
- Fixed the "Create Spec from Component" capability to correctly scaffold the
  component spec from a component which contains special characters in its name.
  Before this change, a spec was scaffolded with either the wrong spec name or
  the incorrect component import which led to invalid JS errors. Fixes
  [#23492](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23492).
- Corrected Cypress environment variable resolution to correctly resolve
  environment variables set with `npm config set`. Fixes
  [#24556](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24556).
- When
  [`experimentalRunAllSpecs=true`](/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing),
  the "Run N specs" directory-level buttons in the Inline Specs List now
  function correctly when activated by the keyboard. Fixes
  [#24762](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24762).
- Fixed unexpected behaviors when verifying a cookie was not returned from
  [`cy.getCookie()`](/api/commands/getcookie). Now it's possible to explicitly
  assert the cookie did not exist with
  `cy.getCookie('foo1').should('not.exist')`. Previously users had to verify
  cookies properties did not exist with `.its('value').should('equal', null)`.
  Addressed in [#24203](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24203).
- Fixed the console output returned from clicking on an aliased intercept in the
  Command Log. It now logs the yielded request/response object associated to the
  intercepted call when clicked, where previously it did not log these details.
  Fixed in [#24623](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24623).
