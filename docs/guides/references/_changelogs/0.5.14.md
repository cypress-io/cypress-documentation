## 0.5.14

_Released 05/06/2015_

**Features:**

- Cypress now works with JS applications that use `pushState` and `replaceState`
  routing (commonly known as `HTML5 History`) without having to change any
  application code.
- Cypress now always updates the remote URL whenever your application changes
  its URL through the vast variety of ways it can do this.

**Bugfixes:**

- Removed `iframe` and `link[rel=stylesheet]` elements during DOM revert.
- Server instrument now correctly displays the number of responses their
  corresponding routes have had.
- Spies/Stubs/Mocks instrument now correctly displays the number of calls their
  corresponding methods have had.
- When users navigate between pages with commands, like
  [`.click()`](/api/commands/click), Cypress now correctly waits until the age
  has finished loading before running more commands. Previously this waited for
  the `unload` event, which did not fire synchronously, and ow we bind to
  `beforeunload` which does. Additionally Cypress checks to ensure
  `beforeunload` did not return a non-undefined value.

**Misc:**

- More changes to prepare for server adapters,
