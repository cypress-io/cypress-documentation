## Install binary

Using the `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` environment variable, you can control how
Cypress is installed. To override what is installed, you set
`CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` alongside the `npm install` command.

**This is helpful if you want to:**

- Install a version different than the default npm package.
  ```shell
  CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=13.7.0 npm install cypress@13.7.1
  ```
- Specify an external URL (to bypass a corporate firewall).
  ```shell
  CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=https://company.domain.com/cypress.zip npm install cypress
  ```
- Specify a file to install locally instead of using the internet.
  ```shell
  CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=/local/path/to/cypress.zip npm install cypress
  ```

In all cases, the fact that the binary was installed from a custom location _is
not saved in your `package.json` file_. Every repeated installation needs to use
the same environment variable to install the same binary.

### Skipping installation

You can also force Cypress to skip the installation of the binary application by
setting `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0`. This could be useful if you want to prevent
Cypress from downloading the Cypress binary at the time of `npm install`.

```shell
CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0 npm install
```

Now Cypress will skip its install phase once the npm module is installed.

## Binary cache

As of version `3.0`, Cypress downloads the matching Cypress binary to the global
system cache, so that the binary can be shared between projects. By default,
global cache folders are:

- **MacOS**: `~/Library/Caches/Cypress`
- **Linux**: `~/.cache/Cypress`
- **Windows**: `/AppData/Local/Cypress/Cache`

To override the default cache folder, set the environment variable
`CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER`.

```shell
CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER=~/Desktop/cypress_cache npm install
```

```shell
CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER=~/Desktop/cypress_cache npm run test
```

Cypress will automatically replace the `~` with the user's home directory. So
you can pass `CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER` as a string from CI configuration files, for
example:

```yml
environment:
  CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER: '~/.cache/Cypress'
```

See also
[Continuous Integration - Caching](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Caching)
section in the documentation.

:::caution

`CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER` will need to exist every time cypress is launched. To
ensure this, consider exporting this environment variable. For example, in a
`.bash_profile` (MacOS, Linux), or using `RegEdit` (Windows).

:::

## Run binary

Setting the environment variable `CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY` overrides where the npm
module finds the Cypress binary.

`CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY` should be a path to an already unzipped binary executable.
The Cypress commands `open`, `run`, and `verify` will then launch the provided
binary.

### Mac

```shell
CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY=~/Downloads/Cypress.app/Contents/MacOS/Cypress cypress run
```

### Linux

```shell
CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY=~/Downloads/Cypress/Cypress cypress run
```

### Windows

```shell
CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY=~/Downloads/Cypress/Cypress.exe cypress run
```

:::caution

We recommend **not exporting** the `CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY` environment variable,
since it will affect every cypress module installed on your file system.

## Download URLs

If you want to download a specific Cypress version for a given platform
(Operating System), you can get it from our CDN.

The download server URL is `https://download.cypress.io`.

We currently have the following downloads available:

- Windows 64-bit (`?platform=win32&arch=x64`)
- Linux 64-bit (`?platform=linux`)
- macOS 64-bit (`?platform=darwin`)

Here are the available download URLs:

See
[https://download.cypress.io/desktop.json](https://download.cypress.io/desktop.json)
for all available platforms.

| Method | URL                                   | Description                                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/desktop`                            | Download Cypress at latest version (platform auto-detected)                |
| `GET`  | `/desktop.json`                       | Returns JSON containing latest available CDN destinations                  |
| `GET`  | `/desktop?platform=p&arch=a`          | Download Cypress for a specific platform and/or architecture               |
| `GET`  | `/desktop/:version`                   | Download Cypress with a specified version                                  |
| `GET`  | `/desktop/:version?platform=p&arch=a` | Download Cypress with a specified version and platform and/or architecture |

**Example of downloading Cypress `12.17.4` for Windows 64-bit:**

```text
https://download.cypress.io/desktop/12.17.4?platform=win32&arch=x64
```

## Mirroring

If you choose to mirror the entire Cypress download site, you can specify
`CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR` to set the download server URL from
`https://download.cypress.io` to your own mirror.

For example:

```shell
CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR="https://www.example.com" cypress install
```

Cypress will then attempt to download a binary with this format:
`https://www.example.com/desktop/:version?platform=p`

## Download path template

Starting with Cypress 9.3.0, you can use the `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE`
environment variable to download the Cypress binary from a custom URL that's
generated based on endpoint, version, platform and architecture.

**The following replacements are supported:**

- `${endpoint}` is replaced with `https://download.cypress.io/desktop/:version`.
  If `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR` is set, its value is used instead of
  `https://download.cypress.io` (note that the `/desktop` remains!)
- `${platform}` is replaced with the platform the installation is running on
  (e.g. `win32`, `linux`, `darwin`)
- `${arch}` is replaced with the architecture the installation is running on
  (e.g. `x64`, `arm64`)
- Starting with Cypress 10.6.0, `${version}` is replaced with the version number
  that's being installed (e.g. `10.11.0`)

**Examples:**

To install the binary from a download mirror that matches the exact file
structure of `https://cdn.cypress.io` (works for Cypress 9.3.0 or newer):

```shell
export CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR=https://cypress-download.local
export CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE='${endpoint}/${platform}-${arch}/cypress.zip'
# Example of a resulting URL: https://cypress-download.local/desktop/10.11.0/linux-x64/cypress.zip
```

To install the binary from a download server with a custom file structure (works
for Cypress 10.6.0 or newer):

```shell
export CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE='https://software.local/cypress/${platform}/${arch}/${version}/cypress.zip'
# Example of a resulting URL: https://software.local/cypress/linux/x64/10.11.0/cypress.zip
```

To define `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE` in `.npmrc`, put a backslash before
every `$` (works for Cypress 9.5.3 or newer):

```ini
CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE=\${endpoint}/\${platform}-\${arch}/cypress.zip
```

## Using a custom certificate authority (CA)

Cypress can be configured to use the `ca` and `cafile` options from your npm
config file to download the Cypress binary.

For example, to use the CA at `/home/person/certs/ca.crt` when downloading
Cypress, add the following to your `.npmrc`:

```shell
cafile=/home/person/certs/ca.crt
```

If neither `cafile` nor `ca` are set, Cypress looks at the system environment
variable `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` and uses the corresponding certificate(s) as an
extension for the trusted certificate authority when downloading the Cypress
binary.

Note that the npm config is used as a replacement, and the node environment
variable is used as an extension.

## Opt out of sending exception data to Cypress

When an exception is thrown regarding Cypress, we send along the exception data
to `https://api.cypress.io`. We solely use this information to help develop a
better product.

If you would like to opt out of sending any exception data to Cypress, you can
do so by setting `CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0` in your system environment variables.

### Opt out on Linux or macOS

To opt out of sending exception data on Linux or macOS, run the following
command in a terminal before installing Cypress:

```shell
export CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0
```

To make these changes permanent, you can add this command to your shell's
`~/.profile` (`~/.zsh_profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, etc.) to run them on every
login.

### Opt out on Windows

To opt out of sending exception data on Windows, run the following command in
the Command Prompt before installing Cypress:

```shell
set CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0
```

To accomplish the same thing in PowerShell:

```shell
$env:CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS = "0"
```

To save the `CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS` variable for use in all new shells, use
`setx`:

```shell
setx CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS 0
```

## Opt out of Cypress commercial messaging

Cypress may occasionally display messages in your CI logs related to our
commercial offerings and how they could benefit you during your workflows.

If you would like to opt out of all commercial messaging, you can do so by
setting `CYPRESS_COMMERCIAL_RECOMMENDATIONS=0` in your system environment
variables.

## Install pre-release version

If you would like to install a pre-release version of Cypress to test out
functionality that has not yet been released, here is how:

1. Open up the list of commits to `develop` on the Cypress repo:
   [https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/commits/develop](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/commits/develop)
2. Find the commit that you would like to install the pre-release version of.
   Click the comment icon (highlighted in red below):
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/guides/install/develop-commit-comment-link.png"
     alt="Example of a commit for which pre-releases are available. Comment link highlighted in red."
   />
3. You should see several comments from the `cypress-bot` user with instructions
   for installing Cypress pre-releases. Pick the one that corresponds to your
   operating system and CPU architecture, and follow the instructions there to
   install the pre-release.

Cypress pre-releases are only available for 60 days after they are built. Do not
rely on these being available past 60 days.

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

Cypress requires an [X-server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.Org_Server) (X11) to display the Cypress UI from a Windows Subsystem for Linux installation. This requirement is met by current versions of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) with X11 support being included through Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI (WSLg).

Refer to [GitHub: Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI (WSLg)](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg) for installation instructions on Ubuntu and install the [prerequisite Linux packages](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Linux-Prerequisites) before running Cypress.

Refer to Microsoft Learn [Windows Subsystem for Linux Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) for additional information.

:::info

Cypress.io does not specifically support the use of Cypress under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). If you want to report an issue, please ensure that you can reproduce it without using WSL on one of the Cypress [supported operating systems](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Operating-System).
