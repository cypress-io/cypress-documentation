title: Experiments
---

If you'd like to try out what we're working on in Cypress, you can enable
specific experimental features for your project using the Cypress configuration
options described below.

:::caution

⚠️ The experimental features might change or ultimately be removed without
making it into the core product. Our primary goal for experiments is to collect
real-world feedback during their development. For more information, see the
documentation for all
[Cypress Release Stages](/guides/references/release-stages).

:::

## Configuration

You can pass the [Cypress configuration](/guides/references/configuration)
options below to enable or disable experiments. See our
[Configuration Guide](/guides/references/configuration) on how to pass
configuration to Cypress.

| Option                                        | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `experimentalFetchPolyfill`                   | `false` | Automatically replaces `window.fetch` with a polyfill that Cypress can spy on and stub. Note: `experimentalFetchPolyfill` has been deprecated in Cypress 6.0.0 and will be removed in a future release. Consider using [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) to intercept `fetch` requests instead.                        |
| `experimentalInteractiveRunEvents`            | `false` | Allows listening to the [`before:run`](/api/plugins/before-run-api), [`after:run`](/api/plugins/after-run-api), [`before:spec`](/api/plugins/before-spec-api), and [`after:spec`](/api/plugins/after-spec-api) events in the [setupNodeEvents](/guides/tooling/plugins-guide#Using-a-plugin) function during interactive mode. |
| `experimentalMemoryManagement`                | `false` | Enables support for improved memory management within Chromium-based browsers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode` | `false` | Whether Cypress will search for and replace obstructive code in third party `.js` or `.html` files. NOTE: Setting this flag removes [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).                                                                                |
| `experimentalSourceRewriting`                 | `false` | Enables AST-based JS/HTML rewriting. This may fix issues caused by the existing regex-based JS/HTML replacement algorithm. See [#5273](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5273) for details.                                                                                                                         |
| `experimentalWebKitSupport`                   | `false` | Enable experimental support for running tests in WebKit. When set, installs of `playwright-webkit` will be detected and available in Cypress. See [Launching Browsers](/guides/guides/launching-browsers#WebKit-Experimental) for more information.                                                                            |

## Testing Type-Specific Experiments

You can provide configuration options for either E2E or Component Testing by
creating `e2e` and `component` objects inside your Cypress configuration.

### End-to-End Testing

These experiments are available to be specified inside the `e2e` configuration
object:

| Option                            | Default | Description                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `experimentalStudio`              | `false` | Generate and save commands directly to your test suite by interacting with your app as an end user would.  |
| `experimentalRunAllSpecs`         | `false` | Enables the "Run All Specs" UI feature, allowing the execution of multiple specs sequentially.             |
| `experimentalOriginDependencies`  | `false` | Enables support for `require`/`import` within `cy.origin`.                                                 |
| `experimentalSkipDomainInjection` | `null`  | Removes injecting `document.domain` into `text/html` pages for any sites that match the provided patterns. |

#### Experimental Skip Domain Injection

Under the hood, Cypress
[injects document.domain](/guides/guides/web-security#Examples-of-what-Cypress-does-under-the-hood)
into your test application to lessen the burden of navigation. This is well
described in our [Cross Origin Testing](/guides/guides/cross-origin-testing)
guide. However, some sites have compatibility issues with this feature.

The `experimentalSkipDomainInjection` option disables injecting
`document.domain` inside Cypress. When enabled, all cross-origin/subdomain
navigation must use `cy.origin()`, which may make tests a bit more verbose. We
only recommend including your site pattern if you are having issues running
Cypress out of the box and suspect setting `document.domain` is interfering with
your site's ability to render properly.

Before enabling, verify your application is not implementing frame busting
techniques, which you can mitigate with the
[`modifyObstructiveCode`](/guides/references/configuration#modifyObstructiveCode)
and
[`experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode`](/guides/guides/web-security#Modifying-Obstructive-Third-Party-Code)
flags.

At this point in time, we are aware of the following sites that require the
`experimentalSkipDomainInjection` option to be set to be tested properly:

- Google
- Salesforce

This flag can be enabled by passing an array of origin URLs or
[minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) glob patterns:

:::cypress-config-example

```js
{
  e2e: {
    experimentalSkipDomainInjection: [
      '*.salesforce.com',
      '*.force.com',
      '*.google.com',
    ]
  }
}
```

:::

If using other Salesforce domains, such as
[enhanced domains](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.domain_name_enhanced.htm&type=5),
you will need to add the correct matching glob pattern.

### Component Testing

These experiments are available to be specified inside the `component`
configuration object:

| Option                         | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `experimentalSingleTabRunMode` | `false` | Run all specs in a single tab, instead of creating a new tab per spec. This can improve run mode performance, but can impact spec isolation and reliability on large test suites. |
