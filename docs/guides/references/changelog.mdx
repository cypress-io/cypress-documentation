  Addresses [#21400](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21400).

## 10.8.0

_Released 9/13/2022_

**Features:**

- You can now run tests in Webkit, Safari's browser engine, by enabling the
  [`experimentalWebKitSupport`](/guides/references/experiments) experiment and
  installing
  [`playwright-webkit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-webkit). For
  more details, read
  [our blog post](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2022/09/13/cypress-10-8-experimental-run-tests-in-webkit).
  Addresses [#6422](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6422).

**Performance:**

- Several minor changes were made to reduce Cypress's memory footprint in the
  browser in an attempt to improve test times and reduce the likelihood of
  crashing the launched browser under test. Addressed in
  [#23708](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23708),
  [#23729](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23729),
  [#23737](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23737), and
  [#23738](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23738).

**Bugfixes:**

- The Dashboard will now correctly show whether a video of the spec was uploaded
  to review. Before this change, the Dashboard would shows the error message
  `The media could not be loaded` when a passing test's video was not uploaded
  because `videoUploadOnPasses` was `false`. Fixes
  [#2939](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2939).
- Fixed an issue where the stack traces in `run` mode did not match the stack
  traces shown in `open` mode. Now, in the terminal, users will see the source
  map line and column number in the error stack trace. Fixes
  [#7715](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7715).
- Fixed a bug where projects using Node.js 16.17+ and 18.6+ with ES Modules and
  TypeScript were not working with Cypress. Fixes
  [#22795](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22795),
  [#23393](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23393), and
  [#23552](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23552).
- When searching for specs we now normalize OS-specific path separators so that
  Windows users can use back- and forward-slashes. Fixes
  [#23426](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23426).
- Fixed an regression introduced in Cypress [10.3.0](#10-3-0), and further
  exposed in [10.4.0](#10-4-0), that omitted `same-site` cookies when the URL
  Scheme, Domain, and Top Level Domain matched, but the ports are different
  (i.e. same-site). Fixes
  [#23132](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23132).
- Autoscrolling of the command log can no longer become disabled in `run` mode.
  This fixes an issue observed where the reporter randomly stops scrolling
  during a video recording and the Command log details are not visible. Fixes
  [#16098](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16098) and
  [#22199](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22199).
- The `cypress/react18` [`cy.mount()`](/guides/component-testing/mounting-react)
  command's yielded rerender function has been updated to only create one
  `ReactDom.Root` element. This fixes the issue where state did not persist
  between rerenders, and all lifecycle hooks were reran when executed. Fixes
  [#23357](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23357).
- Fixed a regression introduced in Cypress [10.0.0](#10-0-0) where Cypress was
  incompatible with Chrome v64 - v70. Fixes
  [#23509](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23509).
- Fixes an issue where outdated organization and project information could be
  shown in dialogs when connecting a project to the Cypress Dashboard. Fixes
  [#23538](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23538).
- The `Sec-Fetch-Dest`
  [metadata request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Fetch_metadata_request_header)
  is now set to `document` when the request is sent from the Application Under
  Test when the
  [`experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode`](/guides/references/experiments#Configuration)
  experiment is enabled. This was updated to prevent Google Authentication from
  returning `403 forbidden` in Edge and Electron. Fixes
  [#23720](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23720).
- Correctly override the Electron `userAgent`when the
  [`userAgent`](/guides/references/configuration#Browser) configuration option
  is provided or
  [`experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode`](/guides/references/experiments#Configuration)
  experiment is enabled. Fixes
  [#23597](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23597).
- Fix regression introduced by Cypress [10.0.0](#10.0.0) where the `before:spec`
  plugin event was not triggered in `open` mode when the
  [`experimentalInteractiveRunEvents`](/guides/references/experiments#Configuration)
  experiment was enabled. Fixed #22360.
- Fixed a regression introduced in [10.4.0](#10.4.0) where referencing an
  aliased custom command would return undefined. Fixes
  [#23652](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23652).
- Users can now log into the Dashboard from the "Choose a browser" page of the
  Launchpad even if a browser is not open. Fixes
  [#23779](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23779).
- Fixed a bug where the `cypress/svelte`
  [`cy.mount()`](/guides/component-testing/mounting-svelte) command was not
  logging by default. Fixed in
  [#23771](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23771).
- Fixed an issue where setting the
  [`testIsolation`](/guides/references/configuration#Global) configuration at
  the suite-level would throw on the second test. Fixes
  [#23644](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23644).
- Removed misleading dependency warning in Launchpad for Next.js applications
  using component testing. Fixes
  [#23598](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23598).
- Added [`modifyObstructiveCode`](/guides/references/configuration#Browser)
  TypeScript types. Fixes
  [#22146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22146).
- Assertions will no longer 'vibrate' in the command log when asserting on the
  text of elements with trailing whitespace. Fixed in
  [#23727](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23727).

**Misc:**

- There were some minor improvements made to the UI when configuration files are
  created for a project when using the Project Setup workflow. Addressed in
  [#21847](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21847),
  [#23260](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23260) and
  [#23710](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23710).

## 10.7.0

_Released 8/30/2022_

**Features:**

- Re-introduces the experimental
  [Cypress Studio feature](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/cypress-studio).
  Cypress Studio provides a visual way to generate tests within Cypress by
  recording interactions against the application under test. Cypress Studio is
  available only in end-to-end tests, and must be enabled via the
  `e2e.experimentalStudio` flag. For more details, read
  [our blog post](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2022/08/30/how-to-use-studio-in-cypress-10-7).
  Addresses [#23461](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23461).
- Adds [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) component testing support. This feature is
  being released as an Alpha, meaning there may be breaking changes in future
  Cypress releases. Addresses
  [#23037](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23037).
- The "Latest Runs" and "Average Duration" columns in the specs list now provide
  actions when hovered over to assist with the process of connecting the project
  to the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses
  [#22932](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22932).
- Informational banners were added to display instructions to assist with
  connecting projects to the Cypress Dashboard and recording a first test run.
  Users who don't plan to use the Cypress Dashboard can dismiss the banners to
  prevent seeing them in the future. Addresses
  [#22933](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22933),
  [#22934](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22934),
  [#22798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22798), and
  [#22935](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22935).
- Vue.js projects with a custom spec pattern configuration can now use the
  "Create Spec from Component" capability introduced in v10.5.0. Addresses
  [#23071](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23071).
- Angular component testing projects can provide a custom configuration to the
  Webpack dev server using the
  [`projectConfig`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/component-framework-configuration#Options-API)
  key. This enables support for projects that don't adhere to Angular CLI
  conventions. Addresses
  [#23161](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23161).
- The Cypress `clock` can now be set to a new time using the `setSystemTime`
  function. Addresses
  [#15424](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15424).

**Performance:**

- The `cy.session()` command's behavior has been enhanced to no longer clear the
  dom after a validation function runs. This means a `cy.visit()` command is no
  longer required after running `cy.session()` when a validation function is
  used. Addresses [#22368](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22368).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where Cypress could crash if a websocket upgrade request was
  made over HTTPS. Fixes
  [#22217](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22217).
- Fixed an issue where filtering with the `--spec` CLI flag in run mode option
  would not find any specs if the project was located at the root directory of a
  file system. Fixes
  [#23380](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23380).
- Fixed an issue where projects using Angular `v14.2.0` and above would be
  unable to run component tests. Fixes
  [#23585](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23585).
- Fixed an issue where snapshots performed in XHR requests could reflect the
  primary domain instead of current domain. Fixes
  [#21496](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21496).
- An update was made to correctly track Github Actions retries in the Cypress
  Dashboard. Previously retries data was not being recorded. Addressed in
  [#23445](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23445).
- Fixed an issue where an internal TypeScript type was exposed globally. Fixes
  [#23333](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23333).
- Fixed an issue where an incomplete
  [`component.devServer`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#devServer)
  configuration would cause the specs list to not display in the Cypress App
  when running Component Tests in open mode. Fixes
  [#23486](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23486).

**Miscellaneous:**

- Display a default icon in the browser selection menu for browsers without
  bundled icons. Fixes
  [#21766](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21766).

## 10.6.0

_Released 8/16/2022_

**Features:**

- Introduced a new Cypress experiment,
  [`experimentalSingleTabRunMode`](/guides/references/experiments), for
  Component Testing. When enabled, all specs will execute in a single tab,
  similar to the execution behavior observed in Component Testing alpha in
  Cypress 9, which can improve `run` mode performance, but can impact spec
  isolation and reliability on large test suites. Addresses
  [#22353](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22353).
- Enhanced the
  [`CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE`](/guides/references/advanced-installation#Environment-variables)
  environment variable interpolation to accept and replace `${version}` to allow
  version-specific download paths to be honored. Addresses
  [#5141](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5141),
  [#16976](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16976), and
  [#22864](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22864).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where the Firefox browser was not downloading files to the
  expected directory in Windows. Fixes
  [#17896](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17896).
- Fixed an issue in `cy.session()` where the unique session id logic was not
  persisting registered session ids, which incorrectly allowed session ids to
  override previously used session ids with different setups. Fixes
  [#22381](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22381).
- Fixed an issue where absolute path glob manipulation was incorrectly breaking
  `supportFile` and `specPattern` glob patterns that contained deep instances of
  the working directory. Fixes
  [#23361](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23361).
- Fixed an issue with the Specs list search that prevented full path matching.
  Fixes [#22463](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22463) and
  [#21879](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21879).
- Fixed an issue where Specs list popovers would not display a spec's full
  filename. Fixes [#23064](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23064).

## 10.5.0

_Released 8/15/2022_

**Features:**

- Display a 'flaky test' indicator in the Specs Explorer for specs that are
  known to be flaky in the Dashboard. Addresses
  [#22656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22656) &
  [#22657](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22657).
- The project drop down is now populated when connecting a project with an
  organization that only has one project. Addresses
  [#22936](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22936).
- Added new `testIsolation` configuration option to allow users to revert to
  `legacy` mode when `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` is set to true. Read more
  about
  [test isolation](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation)
  in Cypress to learn more. Addresses
  [#22279](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22279).
- React 18 projects will now be scaffolded with the `cypress/react18` mount
  registration during component setup. Addresses
  [#23033](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23033).
- A list of Vue components in the project are now available for selection when
  generating a new spec for component testing in projects that are using the
  default spec pattern. Addresses
  [#22836](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22836).
- If the user logs in to the Dashboard from the app, but the current project
  does not have a project ID, the user will now be able to enter the connect
  project workflow directly. Addresses
  [#23022](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23022)
- Adds Angular component testing support, including Angular template support and
  support for Angular standalone components. Addresses
  [#22819](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22819).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixes an issue where usage of the `--spec` option would result in no specs
  found if the absolute project path included glob pattern characters. Fixes
  [#22272](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22272).
- Webpack entry points are no longer preserved for CT Webpack projects. Fixes
  [#23224](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23224)
- Fixes an issue where session state was not being reset when changing between
  specs in open mode. Fixes
  [#23146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23146)
- Add delay to header tooltips so they don't pop open unless hovered on. Fixes
  [#23115](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23115)
- Fixed an edge-case bug where Cypress would hang in run-mode if an error was
  thrown from a `test:before:run` event handler. Fixes
  [#23039](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23039).
- Fixes an issue introduced in `10.3.0` where network logs could be missing
  certain information or cause certain requests to be delayed by 500ms. Fixes
  [#23227](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23227).
- In the 'Create Blank Spec' dialog, pressing enter or return when the focus is
  on the spec path input field will create the blank spec. Fixes
  [#21815](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21815).
- Fixes React 18 unmount component handling to resolve the  
  `lastMountedReactDom.unmountComponentAtNode is not a function` error. Fixes
  [#23081](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23081).
- Fixes a regression introduced in Cypress 10.0 where Cypress no longer
  persisted the spec filter in the 'Search Specs' field during a session and
  when a project is reopened. The same filter will be used in the main specs
  list as well as the inline specs list present in the Test Runner. Fixes
  [#21837](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21837).
- Fixed an issue that could lead to infinite recursion and thus a crash when
  running tests that make use of `cy.intercept()`. Fixes
  [#22693](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22693).
- In the Launchpad, the project's name will no longer link to the 'Choose
  Testing Type' step of the launchpad. Fixes
  [#21911](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21911).
- CT projects using Vite `v3` work with Node versions `>=17`. Fixes

  [#20978](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20978).
- Stable Firefox versions 101 and 102 are now explicitly rendered as unsupported
  in Windows due to an unpatched browser incompatibility in those versions.
  Addresses [#23164](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23164).
- Add a warning for users on the old React API, `cypress/react`, who are using
  React 18. Users can now take advantage of the React 18 integration,
  `cypress/react18`. Addresses
  [#23032](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23032).
- `cy.state('subject')` is deprecated and reading from it will log a warning to
  the console. Prefer `cy.currentSubject()` instead. Addresses

## 10.0.0

_Released 6/1/2022_

**Summary:**

Component testing is now beta! We've also reworked the Cypress app from the
ground up to modernize the interface, streamline workflows and integrate better
into your overall development experience. Read more about 10.0 in
[our blog post](https://cypress.io/blog/2022/06/01/cypress-10-release/).

**Breaking Changes:**

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> Please run
`cypress open` to go through our interactive migration which will guide you in
updating your files and configuration options. Read our
[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains some
breaking changes in more detail.**

- We introduced several breaking changes to the **Cypress configuration file**
  detailed below:
  - Using a `cypress.json` configuration file is no longer supported. Replace
    this configuration file with a `cypress.config.js`, `cypress.config.ts`,
    `cypress.config.cjs` or `cypress.config.mjs` file. This change provides
    better flexibility and extensibility of configuration. An error will be
    thrown if both a `cypress.json` file and `cypress.config.{cjs,js,mjs,ts}`
    file are found. Addressed in
    [#18221](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18221),
    [#18300](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18300),
    [#20554](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20554), and
    [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).
  - A Cypress configuration file is now required and passing the CLI flag
    `--config-file=false` will throw an error. Addressed in
    [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).
  - A default configuration file will no longer be auto-generated by Cypress
    when a configuration file doesn't exist. Instead, you can run `cypress open`
    and set up your project with a specific testing type to have this file
    generated. This allows you to customize the configuration setup by
    testing-type for the language and dependencies leveraged in your project.
  - The configuration file's JSON schema is no longer supported since the
    configuration can no longer be provided via a JSON format.
- Cypress has made several **configuration option changes** including renaming
  options, removing options, and only allowing some options within a specific
  testing type. Please run `cypress open` to have our automated migration update
  these options for you.

  - Many configuration options are now specific to either end-to-end or
    component testing. The types have also been updated to match the new
    structure. Addressed in
    [#20677](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20677).
  - The `baseUrl` and `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` configuration options are
    no longer valid as top-level configuration options and can only be defined
    within the `e2e` configuration. Addressed in
    [#20589](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20589) and
    [#21588](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21588).
  - The `supportFile` and `slowTestThreshold` options are no longer valid as
    top-level configuration options and must now be defined within the `e2e`
    and/or `component` configurations.
  - Previously the `supportFile` option defaulted to `cypress/support/index.js`.
    Now the [`e2e.supportFile`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) option
    defaults to `cypress/support/e2e.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` and the
    [`component.supportFile`](/guides/references/configuration#component) option
    defaults to `cypress/support/component.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`. Addressed in
    [#19776](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19776) and
    [#19364](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19364).
  - The `pluginsFile` option was removed. This option should be replaced with
    the new
    [`setupNodeEvents()`](/guides/references/configuration#setupNodeEvents) and
    [`devServer()`](/guides/references/configuration#devServer) configuration
    options. Addressed in
    [#18798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18798) and
    [#20560](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20560).
  - The `testFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced with the new
    `specPattern` option. Addressed in
    [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319) and
    [#20565](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20565).
  - The `integrationFolder` and `componentFolder` options were removed. These
    options were made obsolete by the new `specPattern` option. Addressed in
    [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).
  - The `ignoreTestFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced with the
    new `excludeSpecPattern` option. Addressed in
    [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).
  - The `experimentalStudio` option was removed with the removal of the
    experimental Cypress Studio feature. If this option is configured in your
    project, a warning message will be displayed. Please leave any feedback
    around Cypress Studio
    [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21561). Addressed
    in [#20515](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20515).

- During `cypress open`, the ability to "Run all specs" and "Run filtered specs"
  has been removed. Please leave feedback around the removal of this feature
  [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21628). Your feedback
  will help us make product decisions around the future of this feature.

  Addressed in [#20515](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20515).
- You will no longer be able to run your tests during `cypress run` or
  `cypress open` in
  [browser versions that are not supported by Cypress](/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Browser-versions-supported).

- Generated screenshots and videos will still be created inside their respective
  folders (`screenshotsFolder`, `videosFolder`). However, the paths of generated
  files inside those folders will be stripped of any common ancestor paths
  shared between spec files found by the `specPattern` option and may no longer
  be deterministic. Addressed in
  [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).

**Deprecations:**

- The `cypress open-ct` and `cypress run-ct` commands have been deprecated. Use
  `cypress open --component` and `cypress run --component` instead. Addresses
  [#18418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18418).

**Features:**

- Cypress 10 now includes beta support for **component testing**. More features
  around component testing are detailed below:

  - Component testing is now integrated directly into the main app, allowing you
    to choose which testing experience you want upon launching Cypress. See our
    [current support for frameworks and bundlers](/guides/component-testing/component-framework-configuration).
    Addressed in [#21111](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21111).
  - Cypress will now guide you through installing the component testing
    dependencies and project setup necessary to begin component testing in
    Cypress. Previously this required manual setup and referencing the
    documentation.
  - When you use the Cypress app during `cypress open` to configure your project
    for CT testing, a [`cy.mount()`](/api/commands/mount) command will be
    automatically scaffolded for you in a `ct.supportFile`.
  - You can now create an empty component testing spec file from within the
    Cypress app directly and preview the specfile upon creation.
  - The following component testing plugins are now shipped with Cypress to
    enable easy `cy.mount()` implementation. Your local framework dependencies
    found in `node_modules` will be referenced to prevent adding additional
    dependencies or peer-dependencies to your `package.json`. From now on, the
    latest plugin version will be shipped with each Cypress release. See our
    [current support for frameworks and bundlers](/guides/component-testing/component-framework-configuration).
    Addressed in [#20930](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20930).
    - `@cypress/mount-utils@2.0.0`
    - `@cypress/react@6.0.0`
    - `@cypress/vue@4.0.0`
    - `@cypress/vue2@1.0.0`

- We've enhanced how you can set and refresh **configuration** detailed below:

  - Support for `cypress.config.js|ts|cjs|mjs` configuration files was added.
    Addressed in [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).
  - The Cypress app will now refresh when changes are made in the configuration
    file instead of closing the app. Addressed in
    [#21160](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21160).

- We've added several **new configuration options** detailed below:

  - The [`setupNodeEvents()`](/guides/references/configuration#setupNodeEvents)
    option is a new testing type specific configuration option. It must be
    defined within the [`e2e`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or
    [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component) configurations.
    This option allows you to modify your loaded configuration, listen to events
    and register plugins. This option replaces the `pluginsFile` option.
    Addressed in [#18798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18798) and
    [#20560](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20560).

  - The [`devServer`](/guides/references/configuration#devServer) option is a
    new component testing specific option that must be defined within the
    [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component) configuration.
    This option provides a mechanism for starting a component testing dev-server
    when tests are running.

  - The `specPattern` option is a new testing-type specific configuration option
    that must be defined within the
    [`e2e`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or
    [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component) configurations.
    This option accepts a glob or an array of globs of the spec files to load.
    This option simplifies the spec discovery by replacing the
    `componentFolder`, `integrationFolder` and `testFiles` options. Addressed in
    [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319),
    [#20565](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20565) and
    [#20853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20853).

    - The [`e2e.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) default
      value for new projects is `cypress/e2e/**.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`. For
      existing projects, please run `cypress open` to have your spec files
      automatically migrated to match this `specPattern`. Addressed in
      [#21193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21193).
    - The [`component.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component)
      default value is `**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`.

  - The `excludeSpecPattern` option is a new testing type specific configuration
    option that must be defined within the
    [`e2e`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or
    [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component) configurations.
    This option accepts a glob or an array of globs which allows you to ignore
    spec files that would otherwise be shown in your list of specs. This option
    replaces the `ignoreTestFiles` option. Addressed in
    [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319),
    [#19980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19980),
    [#20763](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20763),
    [#20853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20853).
    - The [`e2e.excludeSpecPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e)
      default value is the same as the replaced `ignoreTestFiles` glob pattern
      of `*.hot-update.js`.
    - The
      [`component.excludeSpecPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component)
      default value is `['**/__snapshots__/*','**/__image_snapshots__/*']` plus
      the `e2e.specPattern` glob patterns.
    - The `**/node_modules/**` pattern is automatically added to both
      `e2e.excludeSpecPattern` and `component.excludeSpecPattern` and can't be
      overridden. This is consistent with <10.0 behavior.
  - Intelligent Code Completion was added with the `defineConfig()` helper
    function. This enables configuration auto-completion and in-line
    documentation in the configuration file in your IDE. While it's not strictly
    necessary for Cypress to parse your configuration, we recommend wrapping
    your config object with `defineConfig()`. Addressed in
    [#18302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18302).

- We've made some updates to **Cypress API commands** detailed below:

  - Enhancements were made to provide visual indication of nested commands and
    logs. With this change, users are now able to click on log groups to print
    additional log details to the dev tools console.
  - The `.within()` command was updated to provide visual indication of logs and
    commands executed in the `.within` command context. Addresses
    [#20433](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20433).
  - The redundant `cy.session()` log is now removed. Address
    [#7673](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7673) in
    [#21457](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21457).

  - Users can now add custom `cy.hover()` and `cy.mount()` implementation using
    `Cypress.Commands.add()` since we don't provide a default implementation.
    Previously users had to use `Cypress.Command.override()` to provide the
    custom implementation. Addresses
    [#18941](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18941).

- We've made some updates to the **Cypress CLI** detailed below:

  - You can now pass in testing type specific configuration options via the
    `--config` CLI flag without nesting JSON. Addressed in
    [#20127](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20127).

  - New `--e2e` and `--component` CLI flags were added to `cypress run` and
    `cypress open` to allow a user to run or launch Cypress for a specific
    testing-type. If a testing-type specific CLI flag is not provided when
    running `cypress run`, Cypress will run end-to-end tests by default.
  - A warning message is now displayed when `cypress open` is ran with the
    `--browser` CLI flag for a browser that does not exist on the system.
    Addressed in [#18473](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18473).
  - If a testing type and browser flag are passed to `cypress open` when
    launching a specific project, the browser will automatically launch.
    Addressed in [#21538](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21538).

- The `cypress open` experience has been updated to take you through our
  **Launchpad** with many features detailed below:

  - When you launch Cypress via `cypress open` you'll be asked whether you want
    to do end-to-end or component testing and taken through the configuration
    necessary to set up your project. Addressed in
    [#18924](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18924).
  - Having files scaffolded on new projects during end-to-end testing is now opt
    in and not automatic. Addressed in
    [#18924](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18924).

  - When Cypress detects you have a `cypress.json` during `cypress run`, it will
    error and ask you to run `cypress open` to migrate. When Cypress detects you
    have a `cypress.json` during `cypress open`, it will guide you through
    project migration to ensure your project continues to work as expected.
    Addressed in [#18924](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18924).

- After launching the browser, there are several new features in our **App**
  detailed below:

  - The Cypress app has been redesigned so that the Command Log and all
    associated navigation display with a dark background.
  - You can now change specs or the browser within the same window as running
    your tests.
  - Many git details are now shown within your current project in Cypress
    including the current branch and the last commit details of each spec in the
    spec explorer. Addressed in
    [#20648](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20648),
    [#21139](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21139),
    [#21436](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21436) and
    [#20744](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20744)
  - When creating a new spec within Cypress, your project's language is detected
    to provide the correct file extension and the `specPattern` is checked to
    ensure the spec is found by Cypress. After creating the spec, you can
    preview the spec that was generated with the option to immediately run the
    spec or create another spec. Addressed in
    [#21225](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21225),
    [#20567](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20567),
    [#20657](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20657),
    [#20962](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20962).
  - The Settings page has been redesigned to more clearly distinguish between
    settings that are specific to the project, your device, and the Dashboard.

**Bugfixes:**

- An error message is displayed when you add a command using
  `Cypress.Commands.add()` that has the same name as an internal reserved
  Cypress command. Addresses
  [#6146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6146).
- A one pixel, left, vertical border was removed that was incorrectly included
  on screenshot artifacts generated from the `cy.screenshot()` command in
  component tests. Addressed in
  [#21019](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21019).
- A memory leak was fixed during `cypress run` for end-to-end tests launched in
  Chromium and Firefox browsers that reduces the overall time it takes to run a
  set of specs and aligns with how the browser is launched once for all specs in
  component testing. With this change, the `before:browser:launch` node event
  will now properly only fire once per run, instead of firing before each spec.
  Addressed in [#19915](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19915).
- The default webpack configuration's host value was changed from `localhost` to
  `127.0.0.1` to support the Node 17+ changes with how DNS names are resolved.
  Addressed in [#21430](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21430).
- Cypress will throw a detailed error when some plugin versions are no longer
  supported in Cypress 10. Addressed in
  [#21169](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21169)

**Dependencies:**

- Added `@cypress/mount-utils@2.0.0` dependency.
- Added `@cypress/react@6.0.0` dependency.
- Added `@cypress/vue@4.0.0` dependency.
- Added `@cypress/vue2@1.0.0` dependency.

**Misc:**

- The Plugins concept in Cypress still exists with the intent to tap into,
  modify or extend the internal behavior(s) of Cypress. It however is expected
  to be used in conjunction with our new `setupNodesEvents` configuration
  option, which was named to reflect that Plugins leverage Cypress's node
  events.
