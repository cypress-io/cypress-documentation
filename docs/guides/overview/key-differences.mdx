## Architecture

Most testing tools (like Selenium) operate by running outside of the browser and
executing remote commands across the network. _Cypress is the exact opposite._
Cypress is executed in the same run loop as your application.

Behind Cypress is a Node server process. Cypress and the Node process constantly
communicate, synchronize, and perform tasks on behalf of each other. Having
access to both parts (front and back) gives us the ability to respond to your
application's events in real time, while at the same time work outside of the
browser for tasks that require a higher privilege.

Cypress ultimately controls the entire automation process from top to bottom,
which puts it in the unique position of being able to understand everything
happening in and outside of the browser. This means Cypress is capable of
delivering more consistent results than any other testing tool.

Because Cypress is
[installed locally](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) on your machine,
it can additionally tap into the operating system for automation tasks. This
makes performing tasks such as
[taking screenshots, recording videos](/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos),
general [file system operations](/api/commands/exec) and
[network operations](/api/commands/request) possible.

## Native access

Because Cypress operates within your application, that means it has native
access to every single object. Whether it is the `window`, the `document`, a DOM
element, your application instance, a function, a timer, a service worker, or
anything else - you have access to it in your Cypress tests.

For instance you can:

- [Stub](/api/commands/stub) the browser or your application's functions and
  force them to behave as needed in your test case.
- Expose data stores so you can programmatically alter the state
  of your application directly from your test code.
- Test edge cases like 'empty views' by forcing your server to send empty
  responses.
- Test how your application responds to errors on your server by modifying
  response status codes to be 500.
- Modify DOM elements directly - like forcing hidden elements to be shown.
- Use 3rd party plugins programmatically. Instead of fussing with complex UI
  widgets like multi selects, autocompletes, drop downs, tree views or
  calendars, you can call methods directly from your test code to control them.
- [Prevent Google Analytics from loading _before_ any of your application code executes](/guides/references/configuration#blockHosts)
  when testing.
- Get synchronous notifications whenever your application transitions to a new
  page or when it begins to unload.
- [Control time by moving forward or backward](/api/commands/clock) so that
  timers or polls automatically fire without having to wait for the required
  time in your tests.
- Add your own event listeners to respond to your application. You could update
  your application code to behave differently when under tests in Cypress. You
  can control WebSocket messages from within Cypress, conditionally load 3rd
  party scripts, or call functions directly on your application.

## Shortcuts

Cypress allows for browser context to be cached with
[`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session). This means as a user, you only need to
perform authentication once for the entirety of your test suite, and restore the
saved session between each test. That means you do not have to visit a login
page, type in a username and password and wait for the page to load and/or
redirect for every test you run. You can accomplish this once with
[`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) and if needed,
[`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin).

## Flake resistant

Cypress knows and understands everything that happens in your application
synchronously. It is notified the moment the page loads and the moment the page
unloads. Cypress even knows how fast an element is animating and will
[wait for it to stop animating](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Animations).
Additionally, it
[automatically waits for elements to become visible](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Visibility),
to [become enabled](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Disability),
and to
[stop being covered](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Covering).
When pages begin to transition, Cypress will pause command execution until the
following page is fully loaded. You can also tell Cypress to
[wait](/api/commands/wait) on specific network requests to finish.

## Debuggability

Above all else Cypress was built for usability.

- There are hundreds of custom error messages describing the exact reason Cypress
failed your test.
- There is a rich UI which visually shows you the command execution, assertions,
network requests, spies, stubs, page loads, or URL changes.
- The Cypress App takes snapshots of your application and enables you to time travel back
to the state it was in when commands ran.
- You can use the Developer Tools while your tests run to see every console
message or network request. You can inspect elements and use
debugger statements in your spec or application code - you can use all the tools you're already comfortable with. This
enables you to test and develop all at the same time.

## Trade offs

While there are many new and powerful capabilities of Cypress - there are also
important trade-offs that we've made in making this possible.
