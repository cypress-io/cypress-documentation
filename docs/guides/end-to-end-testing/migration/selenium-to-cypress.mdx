## Introduction

While both Selenium and Cypress are popular tools for web automation,
each framework possesses distinct strengths and weaknesses. For instance,
Cypress stands out as one of the easiest automation frameworks to begin with,
while Selenium boasts the status of being one of the oldest and most widely used frameworks.

Taking a closer look at Selenium WebDriver reveals its longevity and extensive library of
documentation and troubleshooting guides. Supported by an active community, Selenium benefits
from robust documentation across multiple languages including Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, and
Ruby. Its widespread adoption is further evidenced by its integration into various low-code
tools, underscoring its versatility in browser interaction.

A key differentiator of Cypress, not only from Selenium but also from other test automation frameworks,
is its [unique approach](/guides/overview/key-differences#Architecture) of running tests
inside an interactive browser rather than against one. This approach [minimizes flakiness](/guides/overview/key-differences#Flake-resistant)
and grants users greater control over both the framework and the application under test. Cypress's ability to wait for page loading without explicit
declaration allows for patient execution until the application is fully ready. Additionally, Cypress simplifies test recording
without requiring complex configurations or setups, facilitating easy troubleshooting and bug
reporting with access to screenshots, videos, and time travel debugging.

Furthermore, the addition of [Component Testing](/guides/component-testing/overview) to Cypress has fostered
[collaboration](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2023/01/26/what-cypress-component-testing-means-for-qa-teams) between testing and development teams,
enabling them to work with the same tools and language. This alignment streamlines the testing process and promotes
consistency and efficiency across teams.

## Top 5 reasons to migrate

While migration is often perceived as a hassle, investing in Cypress is undoubtedly worthwhile.
In fact, migrating to Cypress may not even pose a significant challenge.

### 1. Reduction of Flakiness

One of the primary benefits of Cypress is its ability to reduce flakiness in tests. Occasional
test failures can undermine trust in the testing framework. Cypress addresses this concern by
offering features such as automatic retries and implicit waiting on the application, effectively
minimizing flakiness and enhancing test reliability.

### 2. Ease of Setup

Unlike traditional test automation frameworks that require cumbersome setup processes, Cypress
streamlines the setup with just two Node.js commands: ['npm install'](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#npm-install)
and ['npx cypress open'](/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app#cypress-open).
Within seconds, users can have a fully functional framework up and running. Since Cypress utilizes
locally installed browsers, there's no need for complex configurations or additional installations.

### 3. Infinitely Expandable

Recognizing the diverse needs of web applications, Cypress offers extensibility through various
[plugins](/plugins). These plugins, many of which are contributed by the
community, allow users to tailor their testing framework to specific project requirements, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

### 4. Strong Community Support

Cypress boasts a vibrant community that contributes plugins and prioritizes documentation.
With extensive documentation, support initiatives like the [Ambassador program](https://www.cypress.io/ambassadors), and a [Discord
community](https://discord.com/invite/cypress) of over 10,000 testers and developers, Cypress users benefit from wealth of resources and
assistance, making it a highly supported testing framework.

### 5. Ease of Use

Compared to Selenium, Cypress offers a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Features like the [selector
playground](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Selector-Playground) and
[built-in screenshots](/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos) simplify test writing and
debugging, allowing users to focus on creating effective tests without the need for constant navigation between the test server and browser. This
streamlined approach enhances productivity and accelerates the testing process. Cypress [Test Replay](/guides/cloud/test-replay), which provides
the ability to time travel and interactively debug tests in your CI/CD pipeline, is not a capability that Selenium provides. While debugging is never the most enjoyable
task in development, Cypress is here to assist us. With its clear and concise error messages and multitude of plugins for feedback,
debugging has never been easier.

With Cypress, testing becomes not only more reliable and efficient but also more enjoyable for developers and QA professionals alike.

## Evaluating Suitability for Migration

In order for a migration to proceed smoothly, it is important to conduct a thorough analysis of the existing test cases
and framework functionality. This analysis serves as a cornerstone for determining the priority of test case migration since
not all test cases need to be migrated at once. Depending on the organization's needs, emphasis may be placed on high-priority cases rather
than quick wins. Additionally, it is essential to evaluate whether any business or organization-specific logic embedded within the framework
can be rebuilt or migrated to JavaScript or TypeScript.

If the current test automation framework employs the [Page Object Model](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/encouraged/page_object_models/),
it may be advantageous to start with simpler tasks before tackling more complex test cases. Beginning with low-hanging fruit allows for the migration
of selectors and basic interactions, providing the test automation engineer or developer with a gradual introduction to the framework.
This incremental approach facilitates faster migration of additional tests and reduces the complexity of larger, more intricate tests. Alternatively, if the
current framework does not utilize the Page Object Model, selector migration will occur naturally as part of
migrating the actual codebase.

It's important to note that if the Selenium framework relies on XPath, migration will necessitate changing those selectors.
While the 'cypress-xpath' plugin remains functional, it is deprecated and may not be the optimal solution in the long term.

Alternatively, this could present an opportune moment to adopt the Page Object Model methodology,
streamlining test maintenance and enhancing readability.

## Getting started with Cypress

Installing and configuring Cypress is very easy and we have provided step-by-step guides to help you get started.

You will first [install Cypress](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress).
You will then [open the Cypress application](/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app).

Check out our in-depth [E2E getting started guide](/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test).

And now you're all set to start the migration.

## Strategy and Considerations

:::info
If the current automation framework supports Cucumber, jump to the section [Migrating test cases with Cucumber](#Migrating-test-cases-with-Cucumber).
:::

Before starting to write any code, take the time to assess the architecture of your framework. A well-structured
framework will be a great deal easier to maintain and expand in the future.

Some questions to discuss:

- Will we use Page-objects?
- Will we mock API calls?
- How will we divide the tests?

For example: While the utilization of the Page Object Model (POM) has been widely discussed and embraced as a best
practice, there remains divergence in opinion regarding its implementation. Some advocate for a minimalist approach,
wherein the POM solely comprises page selectors, while others advocate for a more comprehensive approach that includes
both selectors and all possible page actions. It's crucial to engage in team discussions to align on POM structure,
thereby avoiding surprises during the initial pull request.

Another critical consideration is whether the team intends to leverage
[Cypress intercept functionality](/api/commands/intercept) to stub API calls.
While this approach reduces the need for end-to-end tests, it significantly increases the number of smaller tests.
For some teams, the heightened maintenance overhead may outweigh the benefits. However, stubbing API requests can diminish
backend dependencies and enhance framework stability.

In larger applications, locating specific tests within the framework can prove challenging. Therefore, establishing
guidelines for [test organization](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests) is essential for creating a maintainable framework. Some teams prefer organizing tests
based on application functionality, while others opt for organization by webpage. While performance and functionality
remain unaffected, clear guidelines on test placement are imperative for framework maintainability.

These considerations serve as a roadmap toward crafting a well-structured, easily maintainable, and enjoyable-to-use framework.
Investing time in contemplation and extensive team discussions regarding these questions will yield significant dividends in the long run.

## Migrating test cases

With thorough preparation underway, it's time to initiate the actual migration process.

One of the first things to migrate would be all page-objects or selectors, and depending on the frontend framework the
developers are using, this could be a quick find and replace. For instance, in Vue.js the selector in Selenium would be
`vl-checkbox` while in Cypress this would be `.vl-checkbox`. This will allow you to quickly have Cypress tests that can
be used to test your application. This may also be an opportunity to review your tests to see how subject to change the
selectors are today. Cypress documents many best practices about how to write robust tests and the section on
[selecting elements](/guides/references/best-practices#Selecting-Elements) is a great resource to review.

One of the most significant changes between Selenium and Cypress is the actual testing syntax.
While Selenium will run a class or different scenarios, Cypress will run every `it` in a `*.cy.js` file.
So, the flow of a test should be transferred inside an `it`. To make matters more structured, it is possible to add
several `it`s inside a `describe`. This allows you as the user to create a subdivision akin to test suites and test cases.

```javascript
describe('General information', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.get('#loginButton').click()
  })

  it('Header is visible', () => {
    cy.get('#header').should('be.visible')
  })

  it('Footer is visible', () => {
    cy.get('#footer').should('be.visible')
  })
})
```

<br />
Another big change is that you no longer need any WebDriver definitions. Cypress
takes care of opening and closing the browser without any explicit prompting, unlike
Selenium. Any code that is used to define the WebDriver is now obsolete.

```java
 WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

 WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);

 driver.quit();
```

<br />
Next would be to replace all the potential actions. The following code is fairly
standard in Selenium frameworks.

```python
wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "myButton"))).click()
```

<br />
It is fairly easy to change this line of code to work inside a Cypress framework.
It could even be done with a find and replace. In Cypress, the command would be the
following:

```Javascript
cy.get('#myButton').click()
```

<br />
Any wait until functionality that you have been using in Selenium is no longer required
in Cypress. This functionality is [built in](/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability).

The next vital part to migrate would be the [assertions](/guides/references/assertions). We can all agree assertions
are moderately vital to a test automation framework. The next piece of code is a
python Selenium assertion to validate if a button is visible. While it is possible
to add third-party libraries, the built-in assertions of Cypress can tackle a wide
range of situations.

```python
assert driver.find_element(By.ID, "myButton").is_displayed()
```

In Cypress, the same command would be:

```javascript
cy.get('#myButton').should('be.visible')
```

Considering the easy and clear syntax of Cypress, transferring all the selectors
might take the longest. And while copying and pasting the selectors is definitely
an option, rewriting the selectors might be required to conform to the best practices.

##### Multiple tabs

When you have the need to interact with multiple browser tabs in Cypress, an official plugin has been provided to accomplish this
goal. The [Puppeteer plugin](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/puppeteer) utilizes Puppeteer's browser API
with one command within Cypress.

##### File upload

Because Selenium cannot interact with the file upload dialog, it provides a way to upload files without opening the dialog. Cypress
provides support uploading files through the built-in [`.selectFile()`](/api/commands/selectfile) command. There are
[many options](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2022/01/19/uploading-files-with-selectfile) available to allow you to upload a single
file, multiple files, and even drag and drop in Cypress.

##### GraphQL

Given the increasing prominence of GraphQL, the community has responded accordingly. Validating the contents of GraphQL
requests or responses is entirely feasible using Cypress's native intercept functionality. This plugin enhances both
the stability and usability of the intercept feature: [Shopify/cypress-graphql](https://github.com/Shopify/cypress-graphql)

## Migrating test cases with Cucumber

If you're currently using a Cucumber framework, [this Cypress plugin](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor) can assist you
in transitioning smoothly. Although it alters the conventional `describe` and `it` functionality, the adjustment process should
be relatively straightforward.

The main difference would be that instead of adding the whole flow into a single `it` section, you add the different steps into
an `it` like section, where the `it` is replaced with the standard Gherkin syntax.

The first snippet comprises plain Cypress code, whereas the second snippet demonstrates the Cucumber version.

```javascript
it("I should see a search bar", () => {
  cy.visit("https://www.duckduckgo.com");
  cy.get("input").should(
    "have.attr",
    "placeholder",
    "Search the web without being tracked"
  )
```

```javascript
import { When, Then } from '@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor'

When('I visit duckduckgo.com', () => {
  cy.visit('https://www.duckduckgo.com')
})

Then('I should see a search bar', () => {
  cy.get('input').should(
    'have.attr',
    'placeholder',
    'Search the web without being tracked'
  )
})
```

<br />
As evident, the actual code or logic remains unchanged. The difference lies in the
structure of the spec file and the framework's architecture.

## Integration with CI/CD Pipeline

### Integration with the current Pipeline

Cypress can be integrated into any pipeline technology using its headless runner. This headless runner leverages
the Electron browser, ensuring minimal adaptation of the current CI/CD. Given the widespread usage of Docker in
most pipelines today, the Cypress pipeline is no exception. Integration becomes effortless by employing a Node.js
docker image or one provided by Cypress via Docker Hub. These Docker images, not only furnished by Cypress,
include various versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

Executing the following command initiates a headless run against the Electron browser. Upon completion, a succinct
table is generated, detailing the number of tests for each 'cy.js' file, in addition to the failed, skipped and passed
tests with the run time of each specific 'cy.js' file. At the bottom of the table, a comprehensive summary displays the
total number of tests run, the duration of the run, and the counts of failed, passed, and skipped tests.

```bash
npx cypress run
```

This would completely replace the Selenium step in your current CI/CD workflow.

### Cypress Cloud

The notable distinction in integration between Cypress and Selenium emerges when discussing
[Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/introduction), a service built on the rich result data coming from tests run in the
open source application.

Cypress.io offers its tailored pipeline structure, meticulously designed to execute tests efficiently.
Accompanying this structure are several advanced features that warrant attention during
migration to Cypress. While it's feasible to harness all the advantages of migration without Cypress Cloud,
it would be remiss not to explore the potential benefits afforded by its features.

Some of the core features include:

##### [Test Replay](/guides/cloud/test-replay)

One of the major difficulties in troubleshooting headless testing is having to reproduce the failure in your local
environment in order to debug failures in CI. Cypress Cloud resolves this issue with Test Replay. Test Replay's
interactive interface allows for faster debugging, enabling your team to time travel through your application under
test to rapidly identify and resolve issues that surfaced in CI. This eliminates the need to reproduce CI issues
locally so you can swiftly get back to shipping valuable software for your users. Gain visibility into the events
leading up to crashes or failures by inspecting the DOM, network events, and console logs of your application under
test exactly as they ran in CI.

##### [Parallelization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization)

To enhance testing efficiency further, Cypress Cloud offers a built-in solution for test parallelization. With a simple
toggle, tests can run in parallel, eliminating the need for complex configurations to run tests concurrently.

Cypress will assign each spec file to an available machine based on our
[balance strategy](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/load-balancing#Balance-strategy).
Due to this balance strategy, the run order of the spec files is not guaranteed when parallelized.

##### [Analytics and Reporting](/guides/cloud/analytics/overview)

The last step in pipeline integration is reporting the results. While most pipelines can report if there is a failure,
precise numbers require a bit more configuration. One of the most popular plugins to show reports is
mochawesome ([cypress-mochawesome-reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-mochawesome-reporter)). This
plugin can easily be integrated into most pipeline infrastructure, with the correct CI/CD plugin.

But even without the mochawesome package, any pipeline infrastructure can register the error code (error code 1) if
there are test failures. And as soon as this error code is found, webhooks can trigger a notification in your medium of choice.

Cypress Cloud can also serve as an automated pipeline integration, furnishing [built-in analytics and reporting capabilities](/guides/cloud/analytics/overview). This feature grants you visibility into metrics such as run duration,
flaky tests, and the slowest-performing tests, enabling comprehensive monitoring of test health at scale. Moreover, this
negates the necessity of adding another package or dependency, as Cypress Cloud seamlessly interacts with the tests.
