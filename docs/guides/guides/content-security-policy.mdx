Content Security Policy (CSP) is a browser security feature that allows you to
restrict the resources that can be loaded into your application. This can be
problematic for Cypress, because it needs to inject JavaScript into your
application in order to run tests and interact with the DOM. This page describes
how Cypress handles CSP and how to configure it to work with your application.

There are two ways to implement CSP:

- [Meta tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#http-equiv)
- [HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)

The `<meta>` tag implementation is fully supported by Cypress without any
configuration required. This is because Cypress loads the necessary `<script>`
tags into your application before any `<meta>` tag is parsed. This prevents any
CSP directives from being applied to the script loaded by Cypress.

The second implementation requires you to configure Cypress to allow the headers
to be sent to your application. By default, Cypress will remove any CSP headers
from the response before it is sent to the browser. This is done to prevent
Cypress from being blocked by the browser's CSP implementation.

For most application tests, this should not cause any issues. However, if you
are testing your application's CSP implementation, you will need to configure
Cypress to allow the headers to be sent to the browser. You can do this by
setting the
[`experimentalCspAllowList`](/guides/references/experiments#Experimental-CSP-Allow-List)
configuration option.

For more information on CSP, see the
[Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
documentation on MDN.
