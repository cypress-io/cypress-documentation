## Screenshots

Cypress comes with the ability to take screenshots, whether you are running via
`cypress open` or `cypress run`, even in CI.

To take a manual screenshot you can use the
[`cy.screenshot()`](/api/commands/screenshot) command.

Additionally, Cypress will automatically capture screenshots when a failure
happens during `cypress run`. Screenshots on failure are _not_ automatically
taken during `cypress open`.

Capturing of screenshots when a test fails can be turned off entirely by setting
[`screenshotOnRunFailure`](/guides/references/configuration#Screenshots) to
`false` from within the
[Cypress configuration](/guides/references/configuration) or by setting
`screenshotOnRunFailure` to `false` in the
[Cypress.Screenshot.defaults()](/api/cypress-api/screenshot-api).

Screenshots are stored in the
[`screenshotsFolder`](/guides/references/configuration#Screenshots) which is set
to `cypress/screenshots` by default.

Cypress clears any existing screenshots before `cypress run`. If you do not want
to clear your screenshots folder before a run, you can set
[`trashAssetsBeforeRuns`](/guides/references/configuration#Screenshots) to
`false`.

## Videos

<VideoRecordingSupportedBrowsers />

Video recording is disabled by default, but can be turned on by setting
[`video`](/guides/references/configuration#Videos) to `true` from within your
configuration.

If enabled, Cypress records a video for each spec file when running tests during
`cypress run`. Videos are _not_ recorded during `cypress open`.

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
{
  video: true
}
```

:::

Videos are stored in the
[`videosFolder`](/guides/references/configuration#Videos) which is set to
`cypress/videos` by default.

When using the `--record` flag while running your tests, videos are processed,
compressed, and uploaded to [Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/introduction) after
every spec file runs, successful or not. To change this behavior to only process
videos in the case that tests fail, see how to
[delete videos for specs without failing or retried tests](/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos#Delete-videos-for-specs-without-failing-or-retried-tests).
Deleting the video will cause the video to not be uploaded to Cypress Cloud.

Cypress clears any existing videos before a `cypress run`. If you do not want to
clear your videos folder before a run, you can set
[`trashAssetsBeforeRuns`](/guides/references/configuration#Videos) to `false`.

### Video encoding

After a video is recorded, Cypress encodes the video to a commonly digestable
format. Part of this encoding process includes video compression.

Compression is disabled by default, meaning this step will be skipped
completely, so the file size of the video will be larger, but the encoding
process is faster. Setting
[`videoCompression`](/guides/references/configuration#Videos) to `true` will
coerce the video compression value to 32 Constant Rate Factor (CRF), which takes
longer to process, but results in a smaller video.

**Enabling compression**

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
{
  videoCompression: true
}
```

:::

If your spec files have a long run duration and
[`videoCompression`](/guides/references/configuration#Videos) is enabled, you
might notice a time gap between a finished spec and a new spec starting during
`cypress run`. During this time, Cypress is encoding the captured video and
possibly uploading it to Cypress Cloud.

**Change compression value from 32**

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
{
  videoCompression: 15
}
```

:::

In addition to enabling or disabling video compress, you can specify the CRF
value used to compress the video. Here are some common scenarios:

- If the machine is encoding the video slowly (which is often the case for
  virtual machines that use less CPU cores), try increasing the CRF value.

- If your videos are extremely low quality, try decreasing the CRF value.

A lower `videoCompression` value will spend less time compressing and result in
a bigger video file size and higher quality video.

:::info

If you are an FFmpeg pro and want to see all the settings and debug messages
during the encoding, run Cypress with the following environment variable:
`DEBUG=cypress:server:video cypress run`

### Control which videos to keep and upload to Cypress Cloud

You may want to have more control over which videos you want to keep and upload
to Cypress Cloud. Deleting videos after the run can save resource space on the
machine as well as skip the time used to process, compress, and upload the video
to [Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/introduction).

To only process videos in the case that a test fails, you can
[delete videos for specs without failing or retried tests](/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos#Delete-videos-for-specs-without-failing-or-retried-tests),
which will not upload the video of passed runs to Cypress Cloud.

For more fine grained control, you can use Cypress's
[`after:spec`](/api/plugins/after-spec-api) event listener that fires after each
spec file is run and delete the video when certain conditions are met.

### Delete videos for specs without failing or retried tests

The example below shows how to delete the recorded video for specs that had no
retry attempts or failures when using Cypress
[test retries](/guides/guides/test-retries).

:::cypress-config-plugin-example

```ts
import fs from 'fs'
```

```ts
on(
  'after:spec',
  (spec: Cypress.Spec, results: CypressCommandLine.RunResult) => {
    if (results && results.video) {
      // Do we have failures for any retry attempts?
      const failures = results.tests.some((test) =>
        test.attempts.some((attempt) => attempt.state === 'failed')
      )
      if (!failures) {
        // delete the video if the spec passed and no tests retried
        fs.unlinkSync(results.video)
      }
    }
  }
)
```

## Now What?

So you are capturing screenshots and recording videos of your test runs, now
what?

### Share Them With Your Team

{/* Line breaks removed to prevent random br elements */}

Something you can take advantage of today is
[Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/introduction): our companion enterprise service
that stores your artifacts for you and lets you view them from any web browser,
as well as share them with your team.

### Visual Regression Test / Screenshot Diffing

Another possibility is visual regression testing: comparing screenshots of past
runs with the current run to ensure that nothing changed.
