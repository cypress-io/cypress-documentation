title: Cross Origin Testing
---

:::info

As of Cypress [v12.0.0](https://on.cypress.io/changelog#12-0-0), Cypress has the
capability to visit multiple origins in a single test via the
[cy.origin()](https://on.cypress.io/origin) command!

:::

Cypress limits each test to visiting domains that share the same superdomain. If
a navigation occurs that does not meet the same superdomain rule, the
[`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) command must be used to execute Cypress
commands inside the newly navigated origin.

But what is same superdomain? It is actually very similar to that of same
origin! Two URLs have the same origin if the protocol, port (if specified), and
host match. Cypress automatically handles hosts of the same superdomain by
injecting the
[`document.domain`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/domain)
property into the visited `text/html` pages. This is why navigations without the
use of the [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) command are solely scope to the
same superdomain.

We understand this is a bit complicated to understand, so we have built a nifty
chart to help clarify the differences!

### Parts of a URL

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/cross-origin-testing/parts_of_a_url.jpg" />

Given the URLs below, all have the same superdomain compared to
`https://www.cypress.io`.

- `https://cypress.io`
- `https://docs.cypress.io`
- `https://example.cypress.io/commands/querying`

The URLs below, however, will have different superdomains/origins compared to
`https://www.cypress.io`.

- `http://www.cypress.io` (Different protocol)
- `https://docs.cypress.io:81` (Different port)
- `https://www.auth0.com/` (Different host of different superdomain)

The `http://localhost` URLs differ if their ports are different. For example,
the `http://localhost:3000` URL is considered to be a different origin from the
`http://localhost:8080` URL.

The rules are:

- <Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red" /> You **cannot** [visit](/api/commands/visit)
  two domains of different superdomains in the same test and continue to interact
  with the page without the use of the [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) command.
- <Icon name="check-circle" color="green" /> You **can** [visit](/api/commands/visit)
  two or more domains of different origin in **different** tests without needing
  [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin).

For practical purposes, this means the following:

```javascript
// This test will run without error
it('navigates', () => {
  cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io')
  cy.visit('https://docs.cypress.io')
  cy.get('selector') // yup all good
})
```

```javascript
// this will error because cypress-dx.com doesn't match the cypress.io superdomain
it('navigates', () => {
  cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io')
  cy.visit('https://www.cypress-dx.com')
  cy.get('selector')
})
```

To fix the above cross-origin error, use `cy.origin()` to indicate which origin
the sequential command should run against:

```javascript
it('navigates', () => {
  cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')
  cy.visit('https://www.cypress-dx.com')
  cy.origin('https://www.cypress-dx.com', () => {
    cy.get('selector') // yup all good
  })
})
```

```javascript
it('navigates', () => {
  cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io')
})

// split visiting different origin in another test
it('navigates to new origin', () => {
  cy.visit('https://cypress-dx.com')
  cy.get('selector') // yup all good
})
```

This limitation exists because Cypress switches to the domain under each
specific test when it runs. For more information on this, please see our Web
Security page regarding
[Different superdomain per test requires cy.origin command](/guides/guides/web-security#Different-superdomain-per-test-requires-cyorigin-command).

#### Other workarounds

There are other ways of testing the interaction between two superdomains. The
browser has a natural security barrier called `origin policy` this means that
state like `localStorage`, `cookies`, `service workers` and many other APIs are
not shared between them anyways. Cypress does offer APIs around `localStorage`,
`sessionStorage`, and `cookies` that are not limited to this restriction.

As a best practice, you should not visit or interact with any website not under
your control.

If your organization uses Single Sign On (SSO) or OAuth then you might choose to
test a 3rd party service other than your superdomain, which can be tested with
[`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin).

We've written several other guides specifically about handling this situation.
