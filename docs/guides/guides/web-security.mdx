Browsers adhere to a strict
[same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).
This means that browsers restrict access between `<iframes>` when their origin
policies do not match.

Because Cypress works from within the browser, Cypress must be able to directly
communicate with your remote application at all times. Unfortunately, browsers
naturally try to prevent Cypress from doing this.

To get around these restrictions, Cypress implements some strategies involving
JavaScript code, the browser's internal APIs, and network proxying to _play by
the rules_ of same-origin policy. It is our goal to fully automate the
application under test without you needing to modify your application's code -
and we are _mostly_ able to do this.

#### Examples of what Cypress does under the hood:

- Injects
  [`document.domain`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/domain)
  into `text/html` pages.
- Proxies all HTTP / HTTPS traffic.
- Changes the hosted URL to match that of the application under test.
- Uses the browser's internal APIs for network level traffic.

When Cypress first loads, the internal Cypress web application is hosted on a
random port: something like `http://localhost:64874/__/`.

After the first [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) command is issued in a test,
Cypress changes its URL to match the origin of your remote application, thereby
solving the first major hurdle of same-origin policy. Your application's code
executes the same as it does outside of Cypress, and everything works as
expected.

<strong>How is HTTPS supported?</strong>

Cypress does some pretty interesting things under the hood to make testing HTTPS
sites work. Cypress enables you to control and stub at the network level.
Therefore, Cypress must assign and manage browser certificates to be able to
modify the traffic in real time.

You'll notice Chrome display a warning that the 'SSL certificate does not
match'. This is normal and correct. Under the hood we act as our own CA
authority and issue certificates dynamically in order to intercept requests
otherwise impossible to access. We only do this for the superdomain currently
under test, and bypass other traffic. That's why if you open a tab in Cypress to
another host, the certificates match as expected.

Note, that Cypress allows you to optionally specify CA / client certificate
information for use with HTTPS sites. See
[Configuring client certificates](/guides/references/client-certificates). If
the remote server requests a client certificate for a configured URL, Cypress
will supply it.

:::

## Limitations

It's important to note that although we do our **very best** to ensure your
application works normally inside of Cypress, there _are_ some limitations you
need to be aware of.

### Different superdomain per test requires `cy.origin` command

Cypress changes its own host URL to match that of your applications. With the
exception of `cy.origin`, Cypress requires that the URLs navigated to have the
[same superdomain](/guides/guides/cross-origin-testing#Parts-of-a-URL) for the
entirety of a single test.

If you attempt to visit two different superdomains, the `cy.origin` command must
be used to wrap Cypress commands of the second visited domain. Otherwise,
Cypress commands will timeout after the navigation and will eventually error.
This is because the commands that were expected to run on the second domain are
actually being run on the first domain.

Without `cy.origin`, you can visit different superdomains in _different_ tests,
but not in the _same_ test. Please read our
[Cross Origin Testing Guide](/guides/guides/cross-origin-testing) for more
information.

Although Cypress tries to enforce this limitation, it is possible for your
application to bypass Cypress's ability to detect this.

#### Examples of test cases that will error without the use of `cy.origin`

1. [`.click()`](/api/commands/click) an `<a>` with an `href` to a different
   superdomain with subsequent Cypress commands being run.
2. [`.submit()`](/api/commands/submit) a `<form>` that causes your web server to
   redirect to you a different superdomain where additional Cypress commands are
   run.
3. Issue a JavaScript redirect in your application, such as
   `window.location.href = '...'`, to a different superdomain where additional
   Cypress commands are run.

In each of these situations, Cypress will lose the ability to automate your
application and will error via command timeout unless the `cy.origin` command is
used.

Read on to learn about
[working around these common problems](/guides/guides/web-security#Common-Workarounds).

### Cross-origin iframes

If your site embeds an `<iframe>` that is a cross-origin frame, Cypress will not
be able to automate or communicate with this `<iframe>`.

#### Examples of uses for cross-origin iframes

- Embedding a Vimeo or YouTube video.
- Displaying a credit card form from Stripe or Braintree.
- Displaying an embedded login form from Auth0.
- Showing comments from Disqus.

It's actually _possible_ for Cypress to accommodate these situations the same
way Selenium does, but you will never have _native_ access to these iframes from
inside of Cypress.

As a workaround, you may be able to use
[`window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage)
to directly communicate with these iframes and control them (if the 3rd party
iframe supports it).

Other than that, you'll have to wait for us to implement APIs to support this
(check our [open issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/136)), or
you can
[disable web security](/guides/guides/web-security#Disabling-Web-Security).

### Insecure Content

Because of the way Cypress is designed, if you are testing an HTTPS site,
Cypress will error anytime you attempt to navigate back to an HTTP site. This
behavior helps highlight a _pretty serious security problem_ with your
application.

#### Example of accessing insecure content

```javascript
// Test code
cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')
```

In your application code, you set `cookies` and store a session on the browser.
Now let's imagine you have a single `insecure` link (or JavaScript redirect) in
your application code.

```html
{/* Application code */}
<html>
  <a href="http://example.cypress.io/page2">Page 2</a>
</html>
```

Cypress will immediately fail with the following test code:

```javascript
// Test code
cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')
cy.get('a').click() // will fail
```

Browsers refuse to display insecure content on a secure page. Because Cypress
initially changed its URL to match `https://example.cypress.io` when the browser
followed the `href` to `http://example.cypress.io/page2`, the browser will
refuse to display the contents.

Now you may be thinking, _This sounds like a problem with Cypress because when I
work with my application outside of Cypress it works just fine._

However, the truth is, Cypress is exposing a _security vulnerability_ in your
application, and you _want_ it to fail in Cypress.

`cookies` that do not have their `secure` flag set to `true` will be sent as
clear text to the insecure URL. This leaves your application vulnerable to
session hijacking.

This security vulnerability exists **even if** your web server forces a
`301 redirect` back to the HTTPS site. The original HTTP request was still made
once, exposing insecure session information.

#### The solution

Update your HTML or JavaScript code to not navigate to an insecure HTTP page and
instead only use HTTPS. Additionally make sure that cookies have their `secure`
flag set to `true`.

If you're in a situation where you don't control the code, or otherwise cannot
work around this, you can bypass this restriction in Cypress by
[disabling web security](/guides/guides/web-security#Disabling-Web-Security).

### Same port per test

Cypress requires that the URLs navigated to have the same port (if specified)
for the entirety of a single test. This matches the behavior of the browser's
normal
[same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

## Common Workarounds

Let's investigate how you might encounter cross-origin errors in your test code
and break down how to work around them in Cypress.

### External Navigation

The most common situation where you might encounter this error is when you click
on an `<a>` that navigates to another superdomain.

```html
{/* Application code that is served at `localhost:8080` */}
<html>
  <a href="https://example.cypress.io">Cypress</a>
</html>
```

```javascript
// Test code
cy.visit('http://localhost:8080') // where your web server + HTML is hosted
cy.get('a').click() // browser navigates to https://cypress.io
cy.get('selector').should('exist') // Cypress errors
```

We do not recommend visiting a superdomain that you don't control in your tests
which you can read more about
[here](/guides/references/best-practices#Visiting-External-Sites)

However, if you control this superdomain, either by owning the hosted instance
or by other means, we recommend testing this superdomain with `cy.origin`.

```javascript
// Test code
cy.visit('http://localhost:8080') // where your web server + HTML is hosted
cy.get('a').click() // browser navigates to https://example.cypress.io
cy.origin('https://example.cypress.io', () => {
  // declare cy.origin command on expected domain
  cy.get('selector').should('exist') // Yup all good
})
```

If not in control of this superdomain, we recommend you test that the `href`
property is correct instead of performing the navigation. This will help lead to
more deterministic tests.

```javascript
// this test verifies the behavior and will run considerably faster
cy.visit('http://localhost:8080')
cy.get('a').should('have.attr', 'href', 'https://example.cypress.io') // no page load!
```

If for any reason the two above methods cannot be leveraged,
[`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) may be an option to verify content as
[`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) is _NOT bound to CORS or same-origin
policy_.

```javascript
cy.visit('http://localhost:8080')
cy.get('a').then(($a) => {
  // pull off the fully qualified href from the <a>
  const url = $a.prop('href')

  // make a cy.request to it
  cy.request(url).its('body').should('include', '</html>')
})
```

### Form Submission Redirects

When you submit a regular HTML form, the browser will follow the HTTP(s)
request.

```html
<!-- Application code that is served at `localhost:8080`-->
<html>
  <form method="POST" action="/submit">
    <input type="text" name="email" />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
  </form>
</html>
```

```javascript
cy.visit('http://localhost:8080')
cy.get('form').submit() // submit the form!
```

If your back end server handling the `/submit` route does a `30x` redirect to a
different superdomain, you will need to use the `cy.origin` command if running
additional Cypress commands after submitting the form.

```javascript
// imagine this is some node / express code
// on your localhost:8080 server

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  // redirect the browser to cypress.io
  res.redirect('https://example.cypress.io')
})
```

You can test this with `cy.origin`, which may look like the following test case:

```javascript
cy.visit('http://localhost:8080')
cy.get('form').submit() // submit the form!
cy.origin('cypress.io', () => {
  cy.url().should('contain', 'cypress.io')
})
```

A common use case for this is Single sign-on (SSO), OAuth, Open ID Connect
(OIDC), or Authentication as a Service platforms, such as Auth0, Okta, Amazon
Cognito, and others.

In these situations, if controlling the domain under test, we recommend that you
test these with `cy.origin`.

```javascript
cy.visit('http://localhost:8080')
cy.get('#login').click() // click a login button, which takes us to our authentication page.
cy.origin('cypress.io', () => {
  cy.get('#username').type('User1')
  cy.get('#password').type('Password123')

  // prompts a sign in that redirects to http://localhost:8080 with a token, cookie, or other means of acknowledgement
  cy.get('button').contains('Sign In').click()
})

cy.get('#user-name-welcome').should('equal', 'Welcome, User1!')
```

If for any reason you cannot leverage `cy.origin`, programmatic authentication
is still an option. In this situation you may `POST` to a different server and
are redirected elsewhere (typically with the session token in the URL). If
that's the case, you can still test this behavior with
[`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request).

In fact we can likely bypass the initial visit altogether and `POST` directly to
your SSO server.

```javascript
cy.request('POST', 'https://sso.corp.com/auth', {
  username: 'foo',
  password: 'bar',
}).then((response) => {
  // pull out the location redirect
  const loc = response.headers['Location']

  // parse out the token from the url (assuming its in there)
  const token = parseOutMyToken(loc)

  // do something with the token that your web application expects
  // likely the same behavior as what your SSO does under the hood
  // assuming it handles query string tokens like this
  cy.visit('http://localhost:8080?token=' + token)

  // if you don't need to work with the token you can sometimes
  // visit the location header directly
  cy.visit(loc)
})
```

### JavaScript Redirects

When we say JavaScript Redirects we are talking about any kind of code that does
something like this:

```html
{/* Application code that is served at `localhost:8080` */}
<html>
  <button id="nav">Navigate to Cypress example</button>
  <script>
    document.querySelector('#nav').addEventListener('click', () => {
      window.location.href = 'https://example.cypress.io'
    })
  </script>
</html>
```

You can test this with `cy.origin`, which may look like the following test case:

```javascript
cy.visit('http://localhost:8080')
cy.get('#nav').submit() // trigger a javascript redirect!
cy.origin('https://example.cypress.io', () => {
  cy.url().should('contain', 'cypress.io')
})
```

### Cross-Origin Errors with `cy.origin`

Sometimes, when using `cy.origin` and especially with websites that are not
under your immediate test control, cross-origin errors may still tend to creep
up. We don't recommend visiting or interacting with sites you
[do not control](/guides/references/best-practices#Visiting-External-Sites).
However, if this is necessary, most of these issues can usually be remedied by
applying` the
[modify obstructive third-party code](/guides/references/experiments#Configuration)
experimental flag or by
[disabling web security](/guides/guides/web-security#Disabling-Web-Security).

## Disabling Web Security

So if you cannot work around any of the issues using the suggested workarounds
above, including
[modifying obstructive third-party code](/guides/guides/web-security#Modifying-Obstructive-Third-Party-Code)
with `cy.origin`, you may want to disable web security.

One last thing to consider here is that every once in a while we discover bugs
in Cypress that lead to cross-origin errors that can otherwise be fixed. If you
think you're experiencing a bug,
[open an issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/new/choose).

:::caution

<strong>Chrome only</strong>

Disabling web security is only supported in Chrome-based browsers. Settings in
`chromeWebSecurity` will have no effect in other browsers. We will log a warning
in this case.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/web-security/chrome-web-security-stdout-warning.jpg"
  alt="chromeWebSecurity warning in stdout"
/>

If you rely on disabling web security, you will not be able to run tests on
browsers that do not support this feature.

:::

### Set `chromeWebSecurity` to `false`

Setting `chromeWebSecurity` to `false` in Chrome-based browsers allows you to do
the following:

- Display insecure content
- Navigate to any superdomain without cross-origin errors with or without
  `cy.origin`
- Access cross-origin iframes that are embedded in your application

Still here? That's cool, let's disable web security!

#### Set `chromeWebSecurity` to `false` in the [Cypress configuration](/guides/references/configuration)

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
{
  chromeWebSecurity: false,
}
```

## Modifying Obstructive Third Party Code

Cypress today has the concept of
[modifying obstructive code](/guides/references/configuration#modifyObstructiveCode),
which is code that may interfere with Cypress being able to run your web
application. The `experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode` flag provides the
same benefits of the
[modifyObstructiveCode](/guides/references/configuration#modifyObstructiveCode)
flag, but additionally applies it to third-party `.js` and `.html` that is being
either loaded or navigated to inside your application. In addition to this, this
flag also does the following:

- Adjusts the User Agent in Electron to appear more chrome-like. This option can
  be overridden with the [userAgent](/guides/references/configuration#Browser)
  config option.
- Removes
  [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity)
  from modified scripts as they will not execute otherwise.
- Updates the `Sec-Fetch-Dest` Metadata header from `iframe` to `document` in
  cases where requests come from the application under test.

Want to enable `experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode`? Let's do it!

:::cypress-config-example

```js
{
  experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode: true
}
```
