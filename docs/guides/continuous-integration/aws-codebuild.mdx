## <Icon name="graduation-cap" /> What you'll learn

- How to run Cypress tests with AWS CodeBuild as part of CI/CD pipeline
- How to parallelize Cypress test runs within AWS CodeBuild

:::

With [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) Amazon Web Services
(AWS) offers developers "...a fully managed build service that compiles your
source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy"
allowing teams to "pay only for the build time you use".

Detailed documentation is available in the
[AWS CodeBuild Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/).

## Basic Setup

The example below is basic CI setup and job using the
[AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) to run Cypress tests within
the Electron browser. This AWS CodeBuild configuration is placed within
`buildspec.yml`.

```yaml
## buildspec.yml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: latest
    commands:
      # Set COMMIT_INFO variables to send Git specifics to Cypress Cloud when recording
      # https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information
      - export COMMIT_INFO_BRANCH="$(git rev-parse HEAD | xargs git name-rev |
        cut -d' ' -f2 | sed 's/remotes\/origin\///g')"
      - export COMMIT_INFO_MESSAGE="$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)"
      - export COMMIT_INFO_EMAIL="$(git log -1 --pretty=%ae)"
      - export COMMIT_INFO_AUTHOR="$(git log -1 --pretty=%an)"
      - export COMMIT_INFO_SHA="$(git log -1 --pretty=%H)"
      - export COMMIT_INFO_REMOTE="$(git config --get remote.origin.url)"
      - npm ci
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - npm run cy:verify
      - npm run cy:info
  build:
    commands:
      - npm run start:ci &
      - npx cypress run --record
```

<strong>Try it out</strong>

To try out the example above yourself, fork the
[Cypress Kitchen Sink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink)
example project and place the above
[AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) configuration in
`buildspec.yml`.

:::

**How this buildspec works:**

- On _push_ to this repository, this job will provision and start AWS-hosted
  Amazon Linux instance with Node.js for running the outlined `pre_build` and
  `build` for the declared commands within the `commands` section of the
  configuration.
- [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) will checkout our code from
  our GitHub repository.
- Finally, our `buildspec.yml` configuration will:
  - Install npm dependencies
  - Start the project web server (`npm start:ci`)
  - Run the Cypress tests within our GitHub repository within Electron.

## Testing in Chrome and Firefox with Cypress Docker Images

:::info

As of version 0.2, CodeBuild does not provide a way to specify a custom image
for single build configurations. One way to solve this is using an
[AWS CodeBuild batch build-list strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/batch-build-buildspec.html#build-spec.batch.build-list).

:::

:::info

**Enabling batch builds in the CodeBuild UI for the project**

Per the
[AWS CodeBuild batch build documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/batch-build-buildspec.html),
AWS CodeBuild creates a separate build for each possible configuration
combination for a
[batch build-list strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/batch-build-buildspec.html#build-spec.batch.build-list).
Therefore, AWS CodeBuild projects must be created or updated to run batch
configuration.

Follow these steps to enable batch configuration for existing AWS CodeBuild
projects:

- Navigate to the AWS CodeBuild Console
- Select the project
- Click "Edit" **-->** "Batch Configuration"
- Create "New service Role" and enter the name of the role
- Leave all other options as optional
- Click "Update batch configuration"
- Start the Build

:::

AWS CodeBuild offers a
[build-list strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/batch-build-buildspec.html#build-spec.batch.build-list)
of different job configurations for a single job definition.

The
[build-list strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/batch-build-buildspec.html#build-spec.batch.build-list)
offers a way to specify an image hosted on DockerHub or the
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).

The Cypress team maintains the official
[Docker Images](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images) for running
Cypress locally and in CI, which are built with Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. For
example, this allows us to run the tests in Firefox by passing the
`--browser firefox` attribute to `cypress run`.

:::tip

<strong>Cypress Amazon Public ECR</strong>

The Cypress team has published it's
[Docker Images](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images) for running
Cypress locally and in CI in the
[Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws).

The images are available in the following
[Amazon ECR Public Galleries](https://gallery.ecr.aws):

- [Cypress 'base' Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/cypress-io/cypress/base)
- [Cypress 'browsers' Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/cypress-io/cypress/browsers)
- [Cypress 'included' Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/cypress-io/cypress/included)

:::

:::info

<strong>Choosing the right Docker Image</strong>

For E2E Testing on a CI provider like AWS CodeBuild, the
[Cypress 'browsers' Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/cypress-io/cypress/browsers)
contains the images to use.

What's the difference in the images?

The `base` Docker images are used by the `browsers` and `included` images for
the base operating system and set of initial dependencies, but does not install
Cypress or additional browsers.

The `browsers` images extend a `base` image and installs one or more browsers
such as Chrome or Firefox.

The `included` images extend a `browsers` image and installs a specific version
of Cypress and adds a Docker entrypoint for the `cypress run` command. These
images are for testing a containerized version of Cypress in a project during
local development and are not used in CI environments.

## Caching Dependencies and Build Artifacts

Caching with [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) directly can be
challenging.

The
[Build caching in AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-caching.html)
document offers details on local or Amazon S3 caching.

Per the documentation, "Local caching stores a cache locally on a build host
that is available to that build host only". This will not be useful during
parallel test runs.

The "Amazon S3 caching stores the cache in an Amazon S3 bucket that is available
across multiple build hosts". While this may sound useful, in practice the
upload of cached dependencies can take some time. Furthermore, each worker will
attempt to save it's dependency cache to Amazon S3, which increases build time
significantly.

Beyond the scope of this guide, but
[AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline) may be of use to cache
the initial source, dependencies and build output for use in AWS CodeBuild jobs
using
[AWS CodePipeline Input and Output Artifacts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome-introducing-artifacts.html).

Reference the
[AWS CodePipeline integration with CodeBuild and multiple input sources and output artifacts sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-pipeline-multi-input-output.html)
example for details on how to configure a CodePipeline with an output artifact.

## Parallelization

[Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/introduction) offers the ability to
[parallelize and group test runs](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization)
along with additional insights and [analytics](/guides/cloud/analytics/overview) for
Cypress tests.

AWS CodeBuild offers a
[batch build-matrix strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/batch-build-buildspec.html#build-spec.batch.build-matrix)
for declaring different job configurations for a single job definition. The
[batch build-matrix strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/batch-build-buildspec.html#build-spec.batch.build-matrix)
provides an option to specify a container image for the job. Jobs declared
within a build-matrix strategy can run in parallel which enables us run
multiples instances of Cypress at same time as we will see later in this
section.

:::info

The following configuration using the `--parallel` and `--record` flags to
[cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) requires setting up
recording test results to [Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/introduction).

:::

### Parallelizing the build

To setup multiple containers to run in parallel, the `build-matrix`
configuration uses a set of variables (`CY_GROUP_SPEC` and `WORKERS`) with a
list of items specific to each group for the build.

The fields are delimited by a pipe (`|`) character as follows:

```yaml
## Group Name | Browser | Specs | Cypress Configuration options (optional)

'UI-Chrome-Mobile|chrome|cypress/tests/ui/*|viewportWidth=375,viewportHeight=667'
```

The `build-matrix` will run all permutations delimited items.

```yaml
batch:
  fast-fail: false
  build-matrix:
    # ...
    dynamic:
      env:
        # ...
        variables:
          CY_GROUP_SPEC:
            - 'UI-Chrome|chrome|cypress/tests/ui/*'
            - 'UI-Chrome-Mobile|chrome|cypress/tests/ui/*|viewportWidth=375,viewportHeight=667'
            - 'API|chrome|cypress/tests/api/*'
            - 'UI-Firefox|firefox|cypress/tests/ui/*'
            - 'UI-Firefox-Mobile|firefox|cypress/tests/ui/*|viewportWidth=375,viewportHeight=667'
```

During the install phase, we utilize shell scripting with the
[cut command](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_(Unix)>) to assign values from
the delimited `CY_GROUP_SPEC` passed to the worker into shell variables that
will be used in the `build` phase when running `cypress run`.

```yaml
batch:
  # ...

phases:
  install:
    commands:
      # Set COMMIT_INFO variables to send Git specifics to Cypress Cloud when recording
      # https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information
      - export COMMIT_INFO_BRANCH="$(git rev-parse HEAD | xargs git name-rev |
        cut -d' ' -f2 | sed 's/remotes\/origin\///g')"
      - export COMMIT_INFO_MESSAGE="$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)"
      - export COMMIT_INFO_EMAIL="$(git log -1 --pretty=%ae)"
      - export COMMIT_INFO_AUTHOR="$(git log -1 --pretty=%an)"
      - export COMMIT_INFO_SHA="$(git log -1 --pretty=%H)"
      - export COMMIT_INFO_REMOTE="$(git config --get remote.origin.url)"
      - CY_GROUP=$(echo $CY_GROUP_SPEC | cut -d'|' -f1)
      - CY_BROWSER=$(echo $CY_GROUP_SPEC | cut -d'|' -f2)
      - CY_SPEC=$(echo $CY_GROUP_SPEC | cut -d'|' -f3)
      - CY_CONFIG=$(echo $CY_GROUP_SPEC | cut -d'|' -f4)
      - npm ci
## ...
```

To parallelize the runs, we need to add an additional variable to the
[build-matrix strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/batch-build-buildspec.html#build-spec.batch.build-matrix),
`WORKERS`.

```yaml
batch:
  fast-fail: false
  build-matrix:
    # ...
    dynamic:
      env:
        # ...
        variables:
          CY_GROUP_SPEC:
            # ...
          WORKERS:
            - 1
            - 2
            - 3
            - 4
            - 5
```

:::info

<strong>Note</strong>

The `WORKERS` array is filled with filler (or _dummy_) items to provision the
desired number of CI machine instances within the
[batch build-matrix strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/batch-build-buildspec.html#build-spec.batch.build-matrix)
and will provide 5 workers to each group defined in the `CY_GROUP_SPEC`.

:::

Finally, the script variables are passed to the call to `cypress run`.

```yaml
phases:
  install:
    # ...
  build:
    commands:
      - npm start:ci &
      - npx cypress run --record --parallel --browser $CY_BROWSER --ci-build-id
        $CODEBUILD_INITIATOR --group "$CY_GROUP" --spec "$CY_SPEC" --config
        "$CY_CONFIG"
```

## Using Cypress Cloud with AWS CodeBuild

:::caution

Dashboard analytics are dependent on your CI environment reliably providing
commit SHA data (typically via an environment variable) which is not always
present by default. This is not a problem for most users, but if you are facing
integration issues with your CodeBuild setup, please make sure the git
information is being sent properly by following
[these guidelines](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information),
or just see
[the example `codebuild.yml` file at the top of this page](#Basic-Setup). If you
are still facing issues after this, please
[contact us](mailto:hello@cypress.io).

:::

In the AWS CodeBuild configuration we have defined in the previous section, we
are leveraging three useful features of
[Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/introduction):
