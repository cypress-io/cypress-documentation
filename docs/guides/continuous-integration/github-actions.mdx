GitHub offers developers [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that
provide a way to **automate, customize, and execute your software development
workflows** within your GitHub repository. Detailed documentation is available
in the [GitHub Action Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## Cypress GitHub Action

<DocsVideo src="https://youtube.com/embed/N0TOFWy1Xvg" />

Workflows can be packaged and shared as
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). GitHub maintains many,
such as the [checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout) and
[Upload/Download Artifact Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts)
actions used below.

The Cypress team maintains the official
[Cypress GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cypress-io) for
running Cypress tests. This action provides npm, pnpm or yarn installation,
custom caching, additional configuration options and simplifies setup of
advanced workflows with Cypress in the GitHub Actions platform.

### Version Number Selection

:::info

<strong>GitHub Action Version Number</strong>

We recommend binding to the action's latest major version by specifying `v5`
when using the action.

:::

For Example:

```yaml
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    steps:
      uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
```

Alternatively, as a mitigation strategy for unforeseen breaks, bind to a
specific
[release version tag](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/releases), for
example `cypress-io/github-action@v5.1.0`. Read the
[Cypress GitHub Action documentation](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#action-version)
for more information.

## Basic Setup

<DocsVideo src="https://youtube.com/embed/vVr7DXDdUks" />

The example below is a basic CI setup and job using the
[Cypress GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cypress-io) to
run Cypress tests within the Electron browser. This GitHub Action configuration
is placed within `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests

on: push

jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # Install NPM dependencies, cache them correctly
      # and run all Cypress tests
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          build: npm run build
          start: npm start
```

:::tip

<strong>Try it out</strong>

To try out the example above yourself, fork the
[Cypress Kitchen Sink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink)
example project and place the above GitHub Action configuration in
`.github/workflows/main.yml`.

:::

**How this action works:**

- On _push_ to this repository, this job will provision and start a
  GitHub-hosted Ubuntu Linux instance to run the outlined `steps` for the
  declared `cypress-run` job within the `jobs` section of the configuration.
- The [GitHub checkout Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout)
  is used to check out our code from our GitHub repository.
- Finally, our Cypress GitHub Action will:
  - Install npm dependencies
  - Build the project (`npm run build`)
  - Start the project web server (`npm start`)
  - Run the Cypress tests within our GitHub repository within Electron.

## Testing on GitHub with Installed Browsers

[GitHub-hosted runners](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) offer images
with pre-installed browsers to use for testing. The `ubuntu` and `windows`
runners each include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge
pre-installed. The `macos` runners additionally include Apple Safari. Refer to
[GitHub Actions Runner Images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/README.md)
for current details.

Use the action's `browser` parameter to select the desired browser. To change
the above example to select Chrome instead of the default browser Electron, add
`browser: chrome` as follows.

```yaml
- name: Cypress run
  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
  with:
    build: npm run build
    start: npm start
    browser: chrome
```

For more examples, see the action's
[Browser](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#browser) section.

## Testing in Chrome and Firefox with Cypress Docker Images

GitHub Actions provides the option to specify a container image for the job.
Cypress offers various
[Docker Images](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images) for running
Cypress locally and in CI.

Below we add the `container` attribute using a
[Cypress Docker Image](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images)
built with Google Chrome and Firefox. For example, this allows us to run the
tests in Firefox by passing the `browser: firefox` attribute to the
[Cypress GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cypress-io).

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests using Cypress Docker Image

on: push

jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: cypress/browsers:node12.18.3-chrome87-ff82
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Install NPM dependencies, cache them correctly
      # and run all Cypress tests
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          # Specify Browser since container image is compiled with Firefox
          browser: firefox
```

## Caching Dependencies and Build Artifacts

The Cypress team maintains the official
[Cypress GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cypress-io) for
running Cypress tests. This action provides npm installation, custom caching,
additional configuration options and simplifies setting up advanced workflows
with Cypress in the GitHub Actions platform.

:::info

Caching of dependencies and build artifacts between installation and worker jobs
can be accomplished with the
[Upload/Download Artifact Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts).

:::

The `install` job below uses the
[upload-artifact](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-a-build-artifact)
action and will save the state of the `build` directory for the worker jobs.

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests with installation job

on: push

jobs:
  install:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: cypress/browsers:node12.18.3-chrome87-ff82
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Save build folder
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build
          if-no-files-found: error
          path: build

      - name: Cypress install
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          # Disable running of tests within install job
          runTests: false
          build: yarn build
```

The
[download-artifact](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/download-a-build-artifact)
action will retrieve the `build` directory saved in the install job, as seen
below in a worker job.

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests with Dependency and Artifact Caching

on: push

jobs:
  # install:
  # ....
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: cypress/browsers:node12.18.3-chrome87-ff82
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Download the build folders
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build
          path: build

      # Install NPM dependencies, cache them correctly
      # and run all Cypress tests
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          # Specify Browser since container image is compiled with Firefox
          browser: firefox
          build: yarn build
```

## Parallelization

<DocsVideo src="https://youtube.com/embed/96Yn_IiQUJI" />

[Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/introduction) offers the ability to
[parallelize and group test runs](/guides/guides/parallelization) along with
additional insights and [analytics](/guides/cloud/analytics) for Cypress tests.

GitHub Actions offers a
[matrix strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix)
for declaring different job configurations for a single job definition. Jobs
declared within a matrix strategy can run in parallel which enables us run
multiples instances of Cypress at same time as we will see later in this
section.

Before diving into an example of a parallelization setup, it is important to
understand the two different types of GitHub Action jobs that we will declare:

- **Install Job**: A job that installs and caches dependencies that will be used
  by subsequent jobs later in the GitHub Action workflow.
- **Worker Job**: A job that handles execution of Cypress tests and depends on
  the _install job_.

### Install Job

The separation of installation from test running is necessary when running
parallel jobs. It allows for reuse of various build steps aided by caching.

First, we'll define the `install` step that will be used by the worker jobs
defined in the matrix strategy.

For the `steps`, notice that we pass `runTests: false` to the Cypress GitHub
Action to instruct it to only install and cache Cypress and npm dependencies
_without running the tests_.

The
[upload-artifact](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-a-build-artifact)
action will save the state of the `build` directory for the worker jobs.

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests with installation job

on: push

jobs:
  install:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: cypress/browsers:node12.18.3-chrome87-ff82
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Cypress install
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          # Disable running of tests within install job
          runTests: false
          build: yarn build

      - name: Save build folder
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build
          if-no-files-found: error
          path: build
```

### Worker Jobs

Next, we define the worker job named `ui-chrome-tests` that will run Cypress
tests with Chrome as part of a parallelized matrix strategy.

:::info

<strong>Note</strong>

Using our
[Cypress GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cypress-io) we
specify `install: false` since our dependencies and build were cached in our
`install` job.

The
[download-artifact](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/download-a-build-artifact)
action will retrieve the `build` directory saved in the install job.

:::

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests with Install Job and UI Chrome Job x 5

on: push

jobs:
  install:
  # ...

  ui-chrome-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: cypress/browsers:node12.18.3-chrome87-ff82
    needs: install
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        # run copies of the current job in parallel
        containers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Download the build folders
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build
          path: build

      - name: 'UI Tests - Chrome'
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          # we have already installed all dependencies above
          install: false
          start: yarn start:ci
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000'
          wait-on-timeout: 120
          browser: chrome
          record: true
          parallel: true
          group: 'UI - Chrome'
          spec: cypress/tests/ui/*
        env:
          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
          # Recommended: pass the GitHub token lets this action correctly
          # determine the unique run id necessary to re-run the checks
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

:::note

The above configuration using the `parallel` and `record` options of the
[Cypress GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cypress-io)
requires setting up recording to [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud).

:::

#### Setting up Parallelization

To setup multiple containers to run in parallel, the `matrix` option of the
`strategy` configuration can be set to `containers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which will
start 5 instances of the defined `container` image.

:::info

<strong>Note</strong>

The `containers` array is filled with filler (or _dummy_) items to provision the
desired number of CI machine instances within GitHub Actions.

:::

:::caution

<strong>Ensure Correct Container</strong>

The `container` attribute must be specified using the
[Cypress Docker Image](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images) in
the configuration that was used in the install job.

:::

```yaml
#...
ui-chrome-tests:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  container: cypress/browsers:node12.18.3-chrome87-ff82
  needs: install
  strategy:
    fail-fast: false
    matrix:
      # run copies of the current job in parallel
      containers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Using Cypress Cloud with GitHub Actions

<DocsVideo src="https://youtube.com/embed/Oqq-_QZWzhg" />

In the GitHub Actions configuration we have defined in the previous section, we
are leveraging three useful features of
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud):

1. [Recording test results with the `record: true` option](https://on.cypress.io/how-do-i-record-runs)
   to [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud):

   - In-depth and shareable [test reports](/guides/cloud/runs).
   - Visibility into test failures via quick access to error messages, stack
     traces, screenshots, videos, and contextual details.
   - [Integrating testing with the pull-request (PR) process](/guides/cloud/github-integration)
     via
     [commit status check guards](/guides/cloud/github-integration#Status-checks)
     and convenient
     [test report comments](/guides/cloud/github-integration#Pull-request-comments).
   - [Detecting flaky tests](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management) and surfacing
     them via [Slack alerts](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management#Slack) or
     [GitHub PR status checks](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management#GitHub).

2. [Parallelizing test runs](/guides/guides/parallelization) and optimizing
   their execution via
   [intelligent load-balancing](/guides/guides/parallelization#Balance-strategy)
   of test specs across CI machines with the `parallel: true` option.

3. Organizing and consolidating multiple `cypress run` calls by labeled groups
   into a single report within [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud). In
   the example above we use the `group: "UI - Chrome"` option to organize all UI
   tests for the Chrome browser into a group labeled "UI - Chrome" in the
   [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) report.

## Cypress Real World Example with GitHub Actions

A complete CI workflow against multiple browsers, viewports and operating
systems is available in the **Cypress Real World App**.

Clone the <Icon name="github" inline="true" contentType="rwa" /> and refer to
the
[.github/workflows/main.yml](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/blob/develop/.github/workflows/main.yml)
file.

  alt="Cypress Real World App GitHub Actions Matrix"
/>

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Re-run jobs passing with empty tests

We recommend passing the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret (created by the GH Action
automatically) as an environment variable. This will allow the accurate
identification of each build to avoid confusion when re-running a build.

```
name: Cypress tests
on: push
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    name: Cypress run
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          record: true
        env:
          # pass GitHub token to detect new build vs re-run build
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

### Pull requests commit message is `merge SHA into SHA`

You can overwrite the commit message sent to Cypress Cloud by setting an
environment variable. See
[Issue #124](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/issues/124) for more
details.

```
name: Cypress tests
on: push
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    name: Cypress run
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          record: true
        env:
          # overwrite commit message sent to Cypress Cloud
          COMMIT_INFO_MESSAGE: ${{github.event.pull_request.title}}
          # re-enable PR comment bot
          COMMIT_INFO_SHA: ${{github.event.pull_request.head.sha}}
```

:::info

We also recommend adding `COMMIT_INFO_SHA` to re-enable
[Cypress bot PR comments](https://on.cypress.io/github-integration#Pull-request-comments).
See
[this comment](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/issues/124#issuecomment-716584972)
for more details.
