GitHub offers developers [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that
provide a way to **automate, customize, and execute your software development
workflows** within your GitHub repository. Detailed documentation is available
in the [GitHub Action Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## Cypress GitHub Action

<DocsVideo src="https://youtube.com/embed/N0TOFWy1Xvg" />

Workflows can be packaged and shared as
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). GitHub maintains many,
such as the [checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout) and
[Upload/Download Artifact Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts)
actions used below.

The official
[Cypress GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cypress-io) is
maintained by Cypress and our community to help ease the setup of Cypress in a
GitHub Action. The action provides dependency installation (via npm, yarn, or
pnpm), built-in caching of Node dependencies, and additional configuration
options for advanced workflows.

### Version Number Selection

:::info

<strong>GitHub Action Version Number</strong>

We recommend binding to the action's latest major version by specifying `v5`
when using the action.

:::

For Example:

```yaml
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    steps:
      uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
```

Alternatively, as a mitigation strategy for unforeseen breaks, bind to a
specific
[release version tag](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/releases), for
example `cypress-io/github-action@v5.1.0`. Read the
[Cypress GitHub Action documentation](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#action-version)
for more information.

## Basic Setup

<DocsVideo src="https://youtube.com/embed/vVr7DXDdUks" />

The example below is a basic CI setup and job using the
[Cypress GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cypress-io) to
run Cypress tests within the Electron browser. This GitHub Action configuration
is placed within `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests

on: push

jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # Install NPM dependencies, cache them correctly
      # and run all Cypress tests
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          build: npm run build
          start: npm start
```

:::tip

<strong>Try it out</strong>

To try out the example above yourself, fork the
[Cypress Kitchen Sink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink)
example project and place the above GitHub Action configuration in
`.github/workflows/main.yml`.

:::

**How this action works:**

- On _push_ to this repository, this job will provision and start a
  GitHub-hosted Ubuntu Linux instance to run the outlined `steps` for the
  declared `cypress-run` job within the `jobs` section of the configuration.
- The [GitHub checkout Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout)
  is used to check out our code from our GitHub repository.
- Finally, our Cypress GitHub Action will:
  - Install npm dependencies
  - Build the project (`npm run build`)
  - Start the project web server (`npm start`)
  - Run the Cypress tests within our GitHub repository within Electron.

## Testing on GitHub with Installed Browsers

[GitHub-hosted runners](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) offer images
with pre-installed browsers to use for testing. The `ubuntu` and `windows`
runners each include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge
pre-installed. The `macos` runners additionally include Apple Safari. Refer to
[GitHub Actions Runner Images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/README.md)
for current details.

Use the action's `browser` parameter to select the desired browser. To change
the above example to select Chrome instead of the default browser Electron, add
`browser: chrome` as follows.

```yaml
- name: Cypress run
  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
  with:
    build: npm run build
    start: npm start
    browser: chrome
```

For more examples, see the action's
[Browser](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#browser) section.

## Testing with Cypress Docker Images

GitHub Actions provides the option to specify a container image for the job.
Cypress offers various
[Docker Images](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images) for running
Cypress locally and in CI.

Below we extend the previous example by adding the `container` attribute using a
[Cypress Docker Image](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images)
built with Google Chrome `107`. Specifying a browser version allow our tests to
execute without any influence from browser version changes in the GitHub runner
image.

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests using Cypress Docker Image

on: push

jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    container: cypress/browsers:node18.12.0-chrome107
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          build: npm run build
          start: npm start
          browser: chrome
```

## Caching Dependencies and Build Artifacts

When working with actions that have multiple jobs, it is recommended to have an
initial "install" job that will download any dependencies and build your app,
and then cache these assets for use later by subsequent jobs.

The Cypress GitHub Action will automatically cache and restore your Node
dependencies for you.

For build assets, you will need to cache and restore them manually.

The `install` job below uses the
[upload-artifact](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-a-build-artifact)
action and saves the state of the `build` directory for the `cypress-run` worker
job.

The
[download-artifact](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/download-a-build-artifact)
action retrieves the `build` directory saved in the `install` job, as seen below
in the `cypress-run` worker job.

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests with Dependency and Artifact Caching

on: push

jobs:
  install:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Cypress install
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          # Disable running of tests within install job
          runTests: false
          build: npm run build

      - name: Save build folder
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build
          if-no-files-found: error
          path: build

  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    needs: install
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Download the build folder
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build
          path: build

      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          start: npm start
          browser: chrome
```

## Parallelization

<DocsVideo src="https://youtube.com/embed/96Yn_IiQUJI" />

[Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/introduction) offers the ability to
[parallelize and group test runs](/guides/guides/parallelization) along with
additional insights and [analytics](/guides/cloud/analytics) for Cypress tests.

GitHub Actions offers a
[matrix strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix)
for declaring different job configurations for a single job definition. Jobs
declared within a matrix strategy can run in parallel, which enables us to run
multiples instances of Cypress at the same time, as we will see later in this
section.

Before diving into an example of a parallelization setup, it is important to
understand the two different types of GitHub Action jobs that we will declare:

- **Install Job**: A job that installs and caches dependencies that will be used
  by subsequent jobs later in the GitHub Action workflow.
- **Worker Job**: A job that handles the execution of Cypress tests and depends
  on the _install job_.

### Install Job

The separation of installation from test running is necessary when running
parallel jobs. It allows for the reuse of various build steps aided by caching.

First, we'll define the `install` step that will be used by the worker jobs
defined in the matrix strategy.

For the `steps`, notice that we pass `runTests: false` to the Cypress GitHub
Action to instruct it only to install and cache Cypress and npm dependencies
_without running the tests_.

The
[upload-artifact](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-a-build-artifact)
action will save the state of the `build` directory for the worker jobs.

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests with installation job

on: push

jobs:
  install:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Cypress install
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          # Disable running of tests within install job
          runTests: false
          build: npm run build

      - name: Save build folder
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build
          if-no-files-found: error
          path: build
```

### Worker Jobs

Next, we define the worker job named `cypress-run` that will run Cypress tests
as a part of a parallelized matrix strategy.

To setup multiple workers to run in parallel, the `matrix` option of the
`strategy` configuration can be used. We specify an arbitrary `containers` array
and fill it with filler (or _dummy_) items to create the desired number of CI
machine instances within GitHub Actions. For instance,
`containers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` will provision five worker instances to run in
parallel.

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests with Install Job and UI Chrome Job x 5

on: push

jobs:
  install:
  # ... omitted install job

  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    needs: install
    strategy:
      # don't fail the entire matrix on failure
      fail-fast: false
      # highlight-start
      matrix:
        # run copies of the current job in parallel
        containers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        # highlight-end
    steps:
      # ... omitted cypress-run steps example
```

:::note

The above configuration uses the `parallel` and `record` options of the
[Cypress GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cypress-io)
requires setting up recording to [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud).

:::

:::caution

<strong>Ensure Correct Container</strong>

If a docker container was used in the install job, the same docker container
must also be used in the worker jobs.

:::

## Using Cypress Cloud with GitHub Actions

<DocsVideo src="https://youtube.com/embed/Oqq-_QZWzhg" />

In the GitHub Actions configuration, we have defined in the previous section, we
are leveraging three useful features of
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud):

1. [Recording test results with the `record: true` option](https://on.cypress.io/how-do-i-record-runs)
   to [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud):

   - In-depth and shareable [test reports](/guides/cloud/runs).
   - Visibility into test failures via quick access to error messages, stack
     traces, screenshots, videos, and contextual details.
   - [Integrating testing with the pull-request (PR) process](/guides/cloud/github-integration)
     via
     [commit status check guards](/guides/cloud/github-integration#Status-checks)
     and convenient
     [test report comments](/guides/cloud/github-integration#Pull-request-comments).
   - [Detecting flaky tests](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management) and surfacing
     them via [Slack alerts](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management#Slack) or
     [GitHub PR status checks](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management#GitHub).

2. [Parallelizing test runs](/guides/guides/parallelization) and optimizing
   their execution via
   [intelligent load-balancing](/guides/guides/parallelization#Balance-strategy)
   of test specs across CI machines with the `parallel: true` option.

3. Organizing and consolidating multiple `cypress run` calls by labeled groups
   into a single report within [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud). In
   the example above, we use the `group: "UI - Chrome"` option to organize all
   UI tests for the Chrome browser into a group labeled "UI - Chrome" in the
   [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) report.

## Cypress Real World Example with GitHub Actions

A complete CI workflow against multiple browsers, viewports, and operating
systems is available in the **Cypress Real World App**.

Clone the <Icon name="github" inline="true" contentType="rwa" /> and refer to
the
[.github/workflows/main.yml](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/blob/develop/.github/workflows/main.yml)
file.

  alt="Cypress Real World App GitHub Actions Matrix"
/>

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Re-run jobs passing with empty tests

We recommend passing the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret (created by the GH Action
automatically) as an environment variable. This will allow the accurate
identification of each build to avoid confusion when re-running a build.

```
name: Cypress tests
on: push
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    name: Cypress run
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          record: true
        env:
          # pass GitHub token to detect new build vs re-run build
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

### Pull requests commit message is `merge SHA into SHA`

You can overwrite the commit message sent to Cypress Cloud by setting an
environment variable. See
[Issue #124](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/issues/124) for more
details.

```
name: Cypress tests
on: push
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    name: Cypress run
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          record: true
        env:
          # overwrite commit message sent to Cypress Cloud
          COMMIT_INFO_MESSAGE: ${{github.event.pull_request.title}}
          # re-enable PR comment bot
          COMMIT_INFO_SHA: ${{github.event.pull_request.head.sha}}
```

:::info

We also recommend adding `COMMIT_INFO_SHA` to re-enable
[Cypress bot PR comments](https://on.cypress.io/github-integration#Pull-request-comments).
See
[this comment](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/issues/124#issuecomment-716584972)
for more details.
