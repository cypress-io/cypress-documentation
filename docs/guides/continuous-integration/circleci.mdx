The
[Cypress CircleCI Orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/cypress-io/cypress)
is the _official_ CircleCI Orb of [Cypress.io](https://cypress.io). Although you
do not need to use the orb to run your tests in CircleCI, the benefit of using
the orb is that it allows you to easily install, cache and run Cypress tests in
CircleCI with less effort. The orb abstracts common steps necessary for running
your tests in CircleCI without an orb to make your life as a developer better!

## Basic Setup

The [Cypress CircleCI Orb](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb) is a
piece of configuration set in your `.circleci/config.yml` file to correctly
install, cache and run Cypress with very little effort.

Full documentation can be found at the
[`cypress-io/circleci-orb`](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb) repo.
For the Orb Quick Start Guide and usage cases, view the CircleCI
[Cypress orb documentation](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/cypress-io/cypress).

A typical project can have:

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  # "cypress-io/cypress@3" installs the latest published
  # version "s.x.y" of the orb. We recommend you then use
  # the strict explicit version "cypress-io/cypress@3.x.y"
  # to lock the version and prevent unexpected CI changes
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@3
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run # "run" job comes from "cypress" orb
```

## Parallelization

A more complex project that needs to install dependencies, build an application
and run tests across 4 CI machines [in parallel](/guides/guides/parallelization)
may have:

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@3
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          start-command: 'npm start'
          cypress-command:
            'npx cypress run --parallel --record --group all tests'
          parallelism: 4
```

Using the orb brings simplicity and static checks of parameters to CircleCI
configuration.

### <Icon name="graduation-cap" /> Real World Example <Badge type="success">New</Badge>

The Cypress <Icon name="github" inline="true" contentType="rwa" /> uses the
Circle CI [Cypress Orb](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb), Codecov
Orb, and Windows Orb to test over 300 test cases in parallel across 25 machines,
multiple browsers, multiple device sizes, and multiple operating systems with
full code-coverage reporting and
[Cypress Cloud recording](https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/7s5okt).
