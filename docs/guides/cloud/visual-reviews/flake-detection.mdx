By enabling [test retries](/guides/guides/test-retries), Cypress Cloud can
detect, flag, and track flaky tests from your recorded Cypress test runs in your
CI/CD pipeline.

:::info

<strong>What is a flaky test?</strong>

A test is considered to be **flaky** when it can pass and fail across multiple
retry attempts without any code changes.

For example, a test is executed and fails, then the test is executed again,
without any change to the code, but this time it passes.

:::info

<strong>What are test retries?</strong>

Cypress has the ability to automatically retry failed tests to mitigate flaky
tests from failing entire test runs or CI builds.

Test retries is **enabled by default** and will retry up to two times in run
mode. You can
[alter this behavior within the Cypress configuration](/guides/guides/test-retries#Configure-Test-Retries).

## Flake Detection

</strong>

**Test flake detection** is available to users with a
[Team Cypress Cloud plan](https://cypress.io/pricing).

One way to battle flaky tests is to detect and monitor them as they occur in an
organized and methodical manner such that you can assess their severity to
assist with prioritizing their fix.

<strong>Test Retries & Flake Detection</strong>

Test retries is the _fundamental mechanism_ that enables the detection of flaky
tests by Cypress Cloud. Therefore, **enabling
[test retries](/guides/guides/test-retries#Configure-Test-Retries) is required**
to take advantage of any flaky test management feature.

:::

### Flagging Flaky Tests

Test runs with flaky tests will be flagged with the number of flaky of tests
within Cypress Cloud "Latest runs" page. Flaky tests runs can also be filtered
in and out via the "Flaky" filter within this page.

  alt="Flagging flaky tests runs in Cypress Cloud"
/>

Any failure across multiple test run attempts triggered by test retrying will
result in a given test case to be flagged as flaky.

## Flake Alerting

:::tip

<strong>
  <Icon name="star" /> Premium Cypress Cloud Feature
</strong>

**Test flake alerting** is available to users with a
[Team Cypress Cloud plan](https://cypress.io/pricing).

:::

Cypress Cloud can provide alerts via [GitHub](/guides/cloud/integrations/github)
and [Slack integrations](/guides/cloud/integrations/slack), to further assist
with staying on top of flake occurrences.

### GitHub

Flake alerting via GitHub PR comments and status checks can be enabled within a
project's GitHub integration settings:

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/flaky-test-management/gh-flake.png"
  alt="GitHub flake alert settings"
/>

After enabling GitHub flake alerting, GitHub PR comments will show the number of
flaky tests associated with the PR within the test summary, and include a
"Flakiness" section highlighting the specific tests that flaked.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/flaky-test-management/flake-pr-comment.png"
  alt="GitHub flake alert pr comment"
/>

### Slack

Flake alerting via Slack can be enabled within Slack integration settings:

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/flaky-test-management/slack-flake.png"
  alt="Slack flake alert settings"
/>

After enabling Slack alerts, Cypress Cloud will send Slack messages whenever
flaky tests are detected:

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/flaky-test-management/flake-slack-alert.png"
  alt="Slack flake alert"
/>
