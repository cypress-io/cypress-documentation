[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) is our enterprise-ready companion
to the open-source Cypress app. Access past test results from your continuous
integegration environment, help analyze and diagnose test failures, and save
time and money by smartly orchestrating future runs. We also integrate with your
favorite developer tools to help streamline your workflows.

Insights are at your fingertips, either on the web or directly in the Cypress
app!

To get started with Cypress Cloud,
[sign up here](https://cloud.cypress.io/signup) for our
[free plan](https://www.cypress.io/pricing) which comes with **3** users and
**500** monthly test results.

## Benefits

### View test run history

Each test run is stored in Cypress Cloud where you can see past results and the
current state of your app on the [Latest Runs](/guides/cloud/runs) page. View
each test's
[command logs, screenshots, video replays, stack traces, and where the test failed in code](/guides/cloud/runs#Test-failures).
Quickly identifing a test failure in CI is just a click away.

<DocsVideo src="https://vimeo.com/806005654" />

### Keep track of test health

View each [run's overview](/guides/cloud/runs#Overview-tab) to see rich
analytics and compare past runs and anaylize trends over time. You can quickly
identify and diagnose unreliable tests with
[Flaky Test Management](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management).

<DocsVideo src="https://vimeo.com/806900039" />

Analyze changes in your set up that might introduce problematic trends.

### Reduce test time & CI costs

[Smart Orchestration](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration) enables you to run
tests across multiple machines simultaneously in your CI environment while
Cypress Cloud coordinates runners and
[balances test loads](/guides/guides/parallelization#Balance-strategy)!

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/introduction/orchestration-diagram.png"
  alt="Diagram comparing serial and parallel test configurations"
/>

You can prioritize recently failed specs with
[Spec Prioritization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration#Spec-Prioritization) to
surface problems earlier, and cancel whole test runs on failure with
[Auto Cancellation](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration#Auto-Cancellation) to save
on resource usage. You can also
[cancel in-progress runs](/guides/cloud/runs#Cancel-run) manually from Cypress
Cloud if you need to.

### Integrate with your favorite tools

#### GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket

Ensure rock-solid reliability by keeping failing code out of your main branch on
[GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) repositories, with
[status checks](/guides/cloud/github-integration#Status-checks) that block
commits from being merged until your Cypress tests are green. Surface test
results directly in your PRs with
[pull request comments](/guides/cloud/github-integration#Pull-request-comments)
that include test run statistics, specific failure details, and deep links to
results in Cypress Cloud for fast debugging.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/status-checks-per-spec.jpg"
  alt="Status checks per spec"
/>

[Business and Enterprise plans](https://www.cypress.io/pricing/) include secure
integration with self-managed
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.5/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server)
and [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/) instances
too.

#### Slack and Jira

Get notified on test progress directly in your team's
[Slack](/guides/cloud/slack-integration) channel.

<DocsImage

  alt="Cypress notification feed in Slack channel"
  width={560}
/>

With [Jira](/guides/cloud/jira-integration) integration, create
[bidirectionally linked Jira tickets](/guides/cloud/jira-integration#Creating-a-Jira-issue-for-a-test-case)
directly from specific test failures.

Lastly you can use our flexible adminstrative functions to configure Cypress
Cloud however you want, grouping [projects](/guides/cloud/projects) into
multiple [organizations](/guides/cloud/organizations) if you have a lot,
checking [usage](/guides/cloud/organizations#Billing-Usage), and administering
[users and permissions](/guides/cloud/users#User-roles). We also provide
[SSO integration](/guides/cloud/organizations#Enterprise-SSO) for teams on our
[Enterprise plan](https://www.cypress.io/pricing/).

### Enterprise features

Our [Enterprise](https://www.cypress.io/pricing/) plans include critical
features for your business, such as
[SSO integration](/guides/cloud/organizations#Enterprise-SSO) and priority
support.

### Cypress app integration

In-app integration let's developers see the latest results

You can also view the latest runs directly in the Cypress app.

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/introduction/cypress-app-specs-page.jpg" />

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/introduction/cypress-app-specs-latest-run.jpg"
  alt="Run info in specs page"
/>

Cypress Cloud is integrated directly into the Cypress app,

For users of the open-source [Cypress app](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app),
we've integrated test run information from Cypress Cloud so developers can see
the latest results across the team, and identify areas of concern.
