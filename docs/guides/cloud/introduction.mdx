[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) is our enterprise-ready companion
to the open-source Cypress app, allowing you to:

- [View past test results](#View-past-test-results) from your CI environment.
- [Analyze and diagnose](#Analyze-and-diagnose-test-health) test health.
- [Reduce test time and save money](#Reduce-test-time--CI-costs) by smartly
  orchestrating future runs across multiple machines.
- [Integrate with your favorite developer tools](#Integrate-with-your-favorite-tools)
  to help streamline your workflows.
- [View CI runs and test health](#Cypress-app-integration) directly from the
  Cypress app.
- [Configure Cypress Cloud how you want](#Flexible-enterprise-configuration-and-single-sign-on) and enable enterprise single sign on.

## Benefits

### View past test results

Each test run is stored in Cypress Cloud, where you can see past results and the
current state of your app on the [Latest Runs](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs) page. View
each test's
[command logs, screenshots, video replays, stack traces, and CI logs](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs#Test-detail-sidebar).
Quickly identifying a test failure in CI is just a click away.

### Analyze and diagnose test health

View each [run's overview](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs#Overview-tab) to see and compare
past runs and analyze trends over time. You can quickly analyze changes in your
setup that might introduce problematic trends as well as identify unreliable
tests with [Flaky Test Management](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management).

The [analytics](/guides/cloud/analytics) page shows test metrics over time,
helping determine the overall health of your test suite. Quickly see which tests
are problematic, getting slower, or growing over time.

### Reduce test time & CI costs

[Smart Orchestration](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/overview) enables you to run
tests across multiple machines simultaneously in your CI environment while
Cypress Cloud coordinates runners and
[balances test loads](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/load-balancing#Balance-strategy) - no setup required!

  alt="Diagram comparing serial and parallel test configurations"
/>

Cypress Cloud's
[Spec Prioritization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization)
lets you prioritize recently failed specs so they run faster on their next run.
The [Auto Cancellation](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation)
feature will cancel a whole test run on failure, saving time and resource usage.
You can also [cancel in-progress runs](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs#Run-cancellation)
manually from Cypress Cloud if you need to.

### Integrate with your favorite tools

#### Source Control providers

Cypress Cloud integrates with [GitHub](/guides/cloud/integrations/source-control/github),
[GitLab](/guides/cloud/integrations/source-control/gitlab), and
[Bitbucket](/guides/cloud/integrations/source-control/bitbucket) to provide rock-solid
reliability by keeping failing code out of your main branch. Use status checks
to block commits from being merged until your Cypress tests are green, and
surface test results directly in your PRs with pull request comments that
include test run statistics, specific failure details, and deep links to results
in Cypress Cloud for fast debugging.

[Business and Enterprise plans](https://www.cypress.io/pricing/) include secure
integration with self-managed
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.5/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server)
and [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/) instances
too.

#### Team Communication

Get notified on test progress directly in your team's
[Slack](/guides/cloud/integrations/slack) or
[Microsoft Teams](/guides/cloud/integrations/teams) channels.

#### Issue Management

Keep the whole team up-to-date with [Jira](/guides/cloud/integrations/jira)
integration. You can
[create bidirectionally linked Jira tickets](/guides/cloud/integrations/jira#Creating-a-Jira-issue-for-a-test-case)
directly from specific test failures.

### Cypress app integration

The [Cypress app](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs#Cypress-App) integrates directly with
Cypress Cloud to provide developers with the latest test results without having
to switch tools.

### Flexible enterprise configuration and single sign on

You can use our flexible administrative functions to configure Cypress Cloud however you want, grouping
[projects](/guides/cloud/account-management/projects) into multiple
[organizations](/guides/cloud/account-management/organizations) if you have a
lot, checking [usage](/guides/cloud/account-management/billing-and-usage), and
administering
[users and permissions](/guides/cloud/account-management/users#User-roles).

We also provide [SSO integration](/guides/cloud/account-management/enterprise-sso)
for teams on our [Enterprise plan](https://www.cypress.io/pricing/).

## Example project

The Cypress
[Real World App (RWA)](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app)
leverages [Cypress Cloud in CI](https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/7s5okt) to
test over 300 test cases in parallel across 25 machines, multiple browsers,
multiple device sizes and multiple operating systems.
