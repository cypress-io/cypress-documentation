- What data does Cypress Cloud store?
- What controls exist to prevent sending data to Cypress Cloud?

:::

## Data Storage

When you run Cypress via `cypress run` passing the `--record` flag the following data is stored in Cypress Cloud for every run:

- Standard output in the terminal
- Test results
- Test definitions
- Cypress configuration (minus Cypress environment variables)
- Screenshots
- Videos
- OS environment variables related to CI and git information

When [Test Replay](#Test-Replay) capturing is enabled, the additional data outlined below will be sent to the Cloud. You can disable capturing: TODO link this data.

- The rendered DOM and CSS styles for the application under test
- Cypress commands and events represented in the Command Log
- Network traffic within your application under test
- Browser console logs

Cypress Cloud does not capture anything related to the code of your application under test or the code within any associated repositories that are associated with your project.

:::caution

Please refer to the [Cypress Cloud Terms of Use](https://cloud.cypress.io/terms-of-use) and our [Security & Compliance](https://www.cypress.io/security/) guide for more specifics around reasonable use of Cypress Cloud, data storage and security at Cypress.

## Cypress Cloud Data Controls

We understand that controlling what data is sent to Cypress Cloud is important to our users. Cypress provides a number of ways to control what data is sent to Cypress Cloud.

If you'd like more granular control over what data is sent to Cypress Cloud, please comment in this discussion: TODO:ADD A LINK TO DISCUSSION or [contact us](https://www.cypress.io/contact/) to discuss your needs.

### Project Access Controls

Cypress Cloud offers controls around the visibility of a project. You can set a project to be public or private. [See docs.](/guides/cloud/account-management/projects#Public-vs-Private)

Setting a project to private means that users invited to the organization will have visibility into the project, its runs, and any data captured by Cypress.

### Disable Test Replay

You can disable capturing data in Test Replay per project by following this guide: TODO: Test Replay guide link. This means Test Replay will not be available for viewing for the project. This will prevent Cypress Cloud from capturing the following data:

- The rendered DOM and CSS styles for the application under test
- Cypress commands and events represented in the Command Log
- Network traffic within your application under test
- Browser console logs

### Screenshot controls 

#### Blackout elements in screenshots

Cypress offers an option to black out (mask) an array of elements from screenshots. [See docs.](/api/commands/screenshot#Arguments) This allows you to black out specific elements on screenshot so that they will not be visible in the locally saved screenshots or to any users that have access to the run in Cypress Cloud.

Add a control to your `cypress/support/index.js` file to set the default blackout options for all screenshots.

```js 
before(() => {
  Cypress.Screenshot.defaults({
    // blackout all elements with 'mask-cy' attribute
    blackout: ['mask-cy']
  })
})
```

Add a control for a specific screenshot to blackout specific elements.

```js
it('admin page loads', () => {
  cy.visit('/admin')
  cy.screenshot({
    blackout: ['.user-name']
  })
})
```

#### Remove Cypress Command Log from screenshots 

Cypress offers an option to hide the Cypress Command Log from screenshots so that no information from that area will captured in screenshots. [See docs](/api/commands/screenshot#Arguments).

Add a control to your `cypress/support/index.js` file to set the default capture options for all screenshots.

```js 
before(() => {
  Cypress.Screenshot.defaults({
    capture: 'viewport' // or fullPage
  })
})
```

Add a control for a specific screenshot to only capture the application under test.

```js
it('sign in page', () => {
  cy.visit('/sign-in')
  cy.screenshot({
    capture: 'viewport' // or fullPage
  })
})
```

### Video controls 

#### Disable video upload

You can delete videos that are recorded when you are passing `video: true` by following [this guide](guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos#Control-which-videos-to-keep-and-upload-to-Cypress-Cloud). This prevents them from being uploaded to Cypress Cloud.

### Cypress Command Log controls 

#### Turn off Cypress Command Log rendering

You can disable showing the entirety of the Cypress Command Log as well as the AUT controls in your tests to prevent all test content from being shown and recorded in any screenshot or video by passing `--no-runner-ui` via the CLI while running Cypress tests. [See docs.](/guides/guides/command-line#Options). This means that the application under test will be the only thing that is rendered while running tests, so the only thing that is captured in screenshots and videos. 

Note that when `--no-runner-ui` is set, data from the Cypress Command Log will still be sent to Cypress Cloud to be generated and displayed in Test Replay if Test Replay is enabled. See [Disable Test Replay](#Disable-Test-Replay) for more information.

#### Mask data in the Cypress Command Log

There are multiple ways to mask data in the Cypress Command Log. Note that when these strategies are used, data within test definitions will still be sent to Cypress Cloud.

##### `log: false` for Cypress commands

You can pass `log: false` as an option to Cypress specific commands in your tests to prevent the data from being shown visibly in the Cypress Command Log and being shown in any captured screenshots or videos.

##### Disable logging of XHR/Fetch requests

By default, Cypress logs all requests that match any [`cy.intercept()`](/api/commands/intercept) in the Cypress Command Log, as well as all XMLHttpRequests and fetch requests. You can use `cy.intercept()` to disable these logs by passing `{ log: false }` in the second parameter. [See docs.](/api/commands/intercept#Disabling-logs-for-a-request)

```js 
before(() => {
  // disable Cypress's default behavior of logging all XMLHttpRequests and fetches
  cy.intercept({ resourceType: /xhr|fetch/ }, { log: false })
})
```

##### Mask Cypress commands in the Cypress Command Log

Users can mask passwords in the Cypress Command Log by using a custom command like the code below. [See docs.](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#Overwrite-type-command)

<DocsImage src="/img/api/custom-commands/custom-command-type-masked-password.png" />

### Network Requests 

Cypress allows users to block requests from specified hosts. [See docs.](/guides/references/configuration#blockHosts)

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/references/v10/blocked-host.png"
  alt="Network tab of dev tools with analytics.js request selected and the response header highlighted"
/>
