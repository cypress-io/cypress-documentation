## Creating a Jira issue for a test case

:::info

<strong>When to create issues for tests?</strong>

Jira issues can be created for both passing and failing tests. The most common
use case would be to create Jira issues for failing tests to better track and
prioritize fixing of pipeline failures within projects managed by Jira
workflows.

:::

Let's walk through creating a Jira issue for a failing test:

1. Click on a failed test within the "Test Results" view of a test run to open
   its results panel.

2. Click on the "Create Issue" button within the results panel, which will
   present the form for creating a Jira issue for the test.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/jira-integration/dashboard-jira-integration-create-issue.png"
     alt="Create Jira Issue Button"
   />

3. Complete and submit the Jira issue creation form by selecting the Jira
   project, issue type, assignee, and additional fields.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/jira-integration/dashboard-jira-integration-modal.png"
     alt="Create Jira Issue Modal"
   />

4. Once the issue is created, a log and reference of the issue will appear
   within results panel of test.

associated test.
