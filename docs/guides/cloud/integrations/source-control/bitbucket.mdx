:::info

<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" /> Bitbucket integration is currently in beta

:::

[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) can integrate your Cypress tests
with your Bitbucket workflow via [status checks](#Status-checks) and
[pull request comments](#Pull-Request-comments). A project first needs to be
[set up to record](/guides/cloud/projects) to Cypress Cloud to use Bitbucket
integration.

:::caution

Bitbucket Integration depends on your CI environment reliably providing a commit
SHA (typically via an environment variable). This is not a problem for most
users, but if you are facing Bitbucket integration issues with your CI setup,
please make sure the git information is being sent properly by following
[these guidelines](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information).
If you still face issues after this, please
[contact us](mailto:hello@cypress.io).

## Installing the Bitbucket integration

:::caution

Bitbucket OAuth2 applications will allow Cypress Cloud to authenticate as the
user that registered the application. That means Cypress will have visibility to
every Bitbucket repo you can access. If you want tighter control over the repos
that Cypress will see, consider creating a service account with more limited
access in Bitbucket.

:::

1. Visit **Integrations** in Cypress Cloud.
1. Click **Install Bitbucket Integration**.
1. (For beta only) You need to enable Bitbucket's
   [development mode](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/enable-bitbucket-cloud-development-mode/)
   for your user account to continue.
1. Continue through the Bitbucket OAuth installation flow in the popup window.
1. Once installed, connect your projects to a Bitbucket repo.
1. (Optional) Configure the behavior for each project.

## Configuring the Bitbucket integration

### Status checks

By default, Cypress will post a **cypress/run** commit status containing the
results of the Cypress run. This will prevent your team from merging any PRs
with failing Cypress tests.

Additionally, Cypress can post a **cypress/flake** commit status indicating
whether the Cypress run contained any flaky tests. This will prevent your team
from merging any PRs with flaky tests.

You can manage this behavior on your project's **Project Settings** page.

### Pull Request comments

By default, Cypress will post a PR comment summarizing the run when the run
completes. It will include test counts, run info, and a summary of tests that
failed or were flaky.

You can manage this behavior on your project's **Project Settings** page.

## Uninstalling the Bitbucket integration

You can remove this integration by visiting the **Integrations → Bitbucket**
page of your organization. This will stop all status checks and PR comments from
Cypress.
