[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) can integrate your Cypress tests
with your GitHub workflow via commit [status checks](#Status-checks) and
[pull request comments](#Pull-request-comments). A project first needs to be
[set up to record](/guides/cloud/projects) to Cypress Cloud to use GitHub
integration.

:::caution

GitHub Integration depends on your CI environment reliably providing a commit
SHA (typically via an environment variable). This is not a problem for most
users, but if you are facing GitHub integration issues with your CI setup,
please make sure the git information is being sent properly by following
[these guidelines](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information).
If you still face issues after this, please
[contact us](mailto:hello@cypress.io).

## Enabling GitHub integration for a project

After completing the Cypress GitHub App installation for your organization, you
can now enable GitHub Integration for _any_ Cypress project.

1. Go to the organization's Integrations page.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/navigate-to-organization-integrations.jpg"
  alt="Visit Organization's Integrations"
  width={600}
/>

2. Scroll down to the GitHub Integration or GitHub Enterprise Integration
   section.

:::info

You can quickly get to a project's GitHub Integrations settings by clicking on
the <strong>Configure</strong> link of the desired project within an
organization's Integrations page:

:::

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/org-settings-with-no-enabled-projects.jpg"
  alt="Org GitHub Integration settings"
/>

3. Select a GitHub repository to associate with the project.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/project-settings-repo-selection.jpg"
  alt="Associate GitHub repo with Cypress project"
/>

Once a GitHub repository is associated with a Cypress project, the GitHub
integration will be immediately enabled:

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/project-settings-selected-repo.jpg"
  alt="GitHub integration enabled for Cypress project"
  width={800}
/>

You can also see all GitHub Integration-enabled Cypress projects within your
organizations **Integrations** page:

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/org-settings-with-projects.jpg"
  alt="Integrations page"
/>

## Status checks

If status checks are enabled within a project's GitHub integration settings,
Cypress Cloud will report Cypress test statuses to GitHub for related commits.
[Status checks](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-status-checks) help
prevent merging a commit or pull request into the rest of your codebase until
all your Cypress tests have passed.

The Cypress GitHub App reports commit status checks in two distinct styles:

- **One check per
  [run group](/guides/guides/parallelization#Grouping-test-runs).**

  <DocsImage
    src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/status-checks-per-group.jpg"
    alt="Status checks per group"
  />

- **Or one check per spec file.**
  <DocsImage
    src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/status-checks-per-spec.jpg"
    alt="Status checks per spec"
  />

Each status check will report the number of test failures or passes, and the
associated **Details** link will direct you to the test run's page within
Cypress Cloud to help you dig deeper into the problem via error messages, stack
traces, screenshots, and video recordings:

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/cloud-details-specs-tab.jpg"
  alt="Cypress Cloud specs tab"
/>

### Disable status checks

GitHub status checks are optional and can be disabled within a project's GitHub
integration settings:

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/status-check-settings.jpg"
  alt="Status checks settings"
/>

## Pull request comments

The Cypress GitHub App can provide detailed test information within the pull
requests via comments that include:

- **Run statistics, such as tests passed, failed, skipped, and over-limit.**
- **Run context details:**
  - The associated Cypress project
  - Run status (passed, failed, etc.)
  - Commit message
  - Commit SHA
  - The time the run started and finished, as well as the duration
- **Run failures:**
  - A summary of the tests that failed
  - A link back to the associated failure within Cypress Cloud

An example of a Cypress pull-request comment can be seen below:

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/pr-comment-fail.jpg"
  alt="Cypress GitHub App PR comment"
/>

### Disable PR comments

PR comments are optional and can be disabled if not needed within a project's
GitHub Integration settings:

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/pr-comments-settings.jpg"
  alt="Status checks settings"
/>
