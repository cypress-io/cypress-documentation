Enterprise Reporting data can be downloaded from Cloud using the Cypress Cloud API. The data is returned in file
formats that allow you to easily incorporate it into your BI reporting platform, as well as a JSON file that can be
programmatically parsed. This API allows you to retrieve your test data at a variety of levels, including
all the way down to the individual test result data which includes status, error messages, runs tags and groups,
Test Replay links, and much more.

All of the data that is viewable in [Enterprise Reporting ](/guides/cloud/analytics/enterprise-reporting)
can be retrieved using this API.

**Data extract API** is available to users with an
[Enterprise Cypress Cloud plan](https://cypress.io/pricing).

## Overview of the API

The reporting data is accessed using an API key that can be accessed from Cloud.
Visit Integrations â†’ Enterprise API in Cypress Cloud and copy the API key that has been created for your
organization. There is nothing to enable. If you are subscribed to the Enterprise Cypress Cloud plan
the ability to access your test data via API is already enabled.

<br />A couple of things to note:

- Data shown in Enterprise Reporting is not real-time. It is available as of midnight UTC of the current day.
  I.e. - data will be populated through "end of day yesterday".
- Historical data is available as specified by your data retention limit in Cypress Cloud.

## API endpoint details

The following API endpoint will be used. Substitute your assigned API key
where indicated by the `YOUR-API-KEY` placeholder text. The `report_id` specifies
the type of data that will be retrieved.

https://cloud.cypress.io/enterprise-reporting/report?token=YOUR-API-KEY&report_id=REPORT-TYPE&export_format=csv

The following query parameters are available for use:

- start_date. **Required** and should be passed in either yyyy-MM-dd or yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss format.

  For example, to request a start date of September 1, 2024, use: `?start_date=2024-09-01`. To request a
  start date of 12:30p UTC on that day, use: `?start_date=2024-09-01T12%3A30%3A00`

- end_date. Optional and should be passed in either yyyy-MM-dd or yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss format. If no end date is
  specified the query will default to today.

  For example, to request an end date of start of day September 1, 2024, use: `?end_date=2024-09-01`. To request an
  end date of 12:30p UTC on that day, use: `?end_date=2024-09-01T12%3A30%3A00`

- projects. Optional, and accepts the name of your Cypress project. The project name should be URL encoded. You can
  pass as many projects parameters as needed.

  For example, to request that the data be filtered for projects _Project e2e_ and _Phoenix_, use: `&projects=Project%20e2e&projects=Phoenix`

- export_format. Specify the type of data format that will be returned in the response file. Valid options include: `csv`, `json`, `xlsx`
