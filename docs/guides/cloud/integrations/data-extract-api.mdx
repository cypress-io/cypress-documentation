Enterprise Reporting data can be downloaded from Cloud using the Cypress Cloud API. The data is returned in file
formats that allow you to easily incorporate it into your BI reporting platform, as well as a JSON file that can be
programmatically parsed. This API allows you to retrieve your test data at a variety of levels, including
all the way down to the individual test result data which includes status, error messages, build tags and groups,
Test Replay links, and much more.

All of the data that is viewable in [Enterprise Reporting ](/guides/cloud/analytics/enterprise-reporting)
can be retrieved using this API.

**Data extract API** is available to users with an

## Overview of the API

The reporting data is accessed using an API key that can be accessed from Cloud.
Visit Integrations â†’ Enterprise API in Cypress Cloud and copy the API key that has been created for your
organization. There is nothing to enable. If you are subscribed to the Enterprise Cypress Cloud plan
the ability to access your test data via API is already enabled.

<br />A couple of things to note:

- Data shown in Enterprise Reporting is not real-time. It is available as of midnight of the current day.
  I.e. - data will be populated through "end of day yesterday".
- Historical data is available as specified by your data retention limit in Cypress Cloud.

## API endpoint details

The following API endpoint will be used. Substitute your assigned API key
where indicated by the `YOUR-API-KEY` placeholder text. The `report_id` specifies
the type of data that will be retrieved.

https://cloud.cypress.io/enterprise-reporting/report?token=YOUR-API-KEY&report_id=REPORT-TYPE&export_format=csv

Query parameters include a mandatory `start_date` and optional `end_date` value. For example,
`?start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-04-15`

Every type of report supports the returning of data in three file formats:

- json
- csv
- xlsx

Specify the type of data formatting by setting the value of the `export_format` query string
parameter to `json`, `csv`, or `xlsx`.
