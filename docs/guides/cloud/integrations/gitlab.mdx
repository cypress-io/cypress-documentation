[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) can integrate your Cypress tests
with your GitLab workflow via [commit statuses](#Commit-statuses) and
[merge request comments](#Merge-Request-comments). A project first needs to be
[set up to record](/guides/cloud/projects) to Cypress Cloud to use GitLab
integration.

:::caution

GitLab Integration depends on your CI environment reliably providing a commit
SHA (typically via an environment variable). This is not a problem for most
users, but if you are facing GitLab integration issues with your CI setup,
please make sure the git information is being sent properly by following
[these guidelines](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information).
If you still face issues after this, please
[contact us](mailto:support@cypress.io).

## GitLab for Enterprise (Self-managed)

:::tip

<strong>
  <Icon name="star" /> Premium Cypress Cloud Feature
</strong>

GitLab for Enterprise (Self-managed) is included in our
[Business and Enterprise paid pricing plans](https://www.cypress.io/pricing).

:::

GitLab for Enterprise (Self-managed) Integration depends on your GitLab instance
being able to reach our Cypress Cloud API on the open internet. If your instance
is running behind a firewall, you may need to reconfigure your security
infrastructure to allow communication with our servers.

## Installing the GitLab integration

:::caution

GitLab OAuth2 applications will allow Cypress Cloud to authenticate as the user
that registered the application. That means Cypress will have visibility into
every GitLab repo the registered user can access. If you want tighter control of
the repos that Cypress will see, consider creating a service account in GitLab
with more limited access permissions.

:::

1. Go to Cypress Cloud
   [Organizations page](https://cloud.cypress.io/organizations) or open the
   organization switcher.
2. Select the organization you wish to integrate with a GitLab.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/select-cypress-organization.jpg"
     alt="Select an organization"
     width={600}
   />

3. Visit the selected organization's **Integrations** page via the side
   navigation.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/navigate-to-organization-integrations.jpg"
     alt="Install Cypress GitLab from Integrations"
     width={600}
   />

4. Click the enable button under **GitLab** or **GitLab for Enterprise
   (Self-managed)**.
5. Follow the instructions to create a new OAuth2 application in GitLab. See the
   [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#adding-an-application-through-the-profile)
   for more details.
6. Copy the Application ID and Secret back to Cypress Cloud.
7. (GitLab Self-managed only) Copy the base URL of your GitLab instance to the
   GitLab URL field in Cypress Cloud.
8. Connect your projects to a GitLab repo in **Project Settings → GitLab
   Integration** or **GitLab for Enterprise Integration**.
9. (Optional) Configure the behavior for each project.

:::warning

If you are running the tests from within a restrictive VPN, see
[which subdomains to add to your allowlist for Cypress Cloud and your GitLab integration to work properly](/faq/questions/cloud-faq#Im-working-at-a-restrictive-VPN-Which-subdomains-do-I-have-to-allow-on-my-VPN-for-Cypress-Cloud-to-work-properly)

## Configuring the GitLab integration

### Status checks

By default, Cypress will post a **cypress/run** commit status containing the
results of the Cypress run. This will prevent your team from merging any MRs
with failing Cypress tests.

Additionally, Cypress can post a **cypress/flake** commit status indicating
whether the Cypress run contained any flaky tests. This will prevent your team
from merging any MRs with flaky tests.

You can manage this behavior on your project's **Project Settings** page.

Reporting on flaky status checks is included in our
[Team, Business and Enterprise paid pricing plans](https://www.cypress.io/pricing).

:::

### Merge Request comments

By default, Cypress will post an MR comment summarizing the run when the run
completes. It will include test counts, run info, and a summary of tests that
failed or were flaky.

You can manage this behavior on your project's **Project Settings** page.

## Uninstalling the GitLab integration

You can remove this integration by visiting the **Integrations → GitLab** or
**GitLab for Enterprise Integration** page of your organization. This will stop
all commit checks and MR comments from Cypress.
