## Enable the Microsoft Teams integration

:::caution

<strong>Ownership Requirements</strong>

In order to enable the Cypress integration for Microsoft Teams, you must be an
admin or owner of both your Cypress Cloud organization and your Microsoft Teams
workspace.

:::

### Per-organization configuration (all projects)

1. Go to Cypress Cloud
   [Organizations page](https://cloud.cypress.io/organizations) or open the
   organization switcher.
2. Select the organization you wish to integrate with Microsoft Teams.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/select-cypress-organization.jpg"
     alt="Select an organization"
     width={500}
   />

3. Visit the selected organization's **Integrations** page via the side
   navigation.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/navigate-to-organization-integrations.jpg"
     alt="Install Cypress Microsoft Teams from Integrations"
     width={500}
   />

4. Click the **Enable** button in the Microsoft Teams section.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/guides/cloud/integrations/enable-teams-integration.jpg"
     alt="Click enable under Microsoft Teams Integration"
     width={1000}
   />

5. You'll naviagte to a window that manages webhooks as a way for Cypress Cloud
   to communicate with Microsoft Teams. First, you must configure an _Incoming
   Webhook_ to a Teams channel.

   In Microsoft Teams:

   - Open the channel in which you want to add the webhook and select **•••**
     from the upper-right corner.

   - Select Connectors from the dropdown menu.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/guides/cloud/integrations/teams-connectors_1.png"
       alt="Visit project settings"
       width={300}
     />

   - Search for Incoming Webhook and select Configure. Provide a name, and
     upload an image for your webhook if necessary.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/guides/cloud/integrations/teams-configure_1.png"
       alt="Visit project settings"
       width={500}
     />

   - Copy and save the unique webhook URL present in the dialog. The URL maps to
     the channel and you can use it to send information to Teams.

   - Select **Done**.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/guides/cloud/integrations/teams-url_1.png"
       alt="Visit project settings"
       width={500}
     />

     The webhook is now available in the Teams channel. For more information,
     see
     [Microsoft Teams - Create Incoming Webhooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet#create-incoming-webhooks-1).

6. Then, add the Teams webhook to your Cypress Cloud Organization.

   In Cypress Cloud:

   - Paste in the Teams webhook URL, choosing the types of notifications your
     team should receive.

     <DocsImage
       src="/img/guides/cloud/integrations/add-teams-webhook.jpg"
       alt="Click enable under Microsoft Teams Integration"
       width={450}
     />

   Once you've configured and added your webhooks, the installation is complete!
   Cypress Cloud will post run results for **all** projects in your organization
   to the specified Microsoft Teams channel.

#### Remove a webhook

You can have Cypress Cloud stop posting notifications to a channel. You cannot
delete the global notification channels from a project.

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page for the project with the installed
   integration.
2. Scroll down to the **Microsoft Teams** section.
3. Under **Actions**, select **Delete** for each webhook you want deleted.

### Per-project configuration

If your organization has multiple teams working on separate projects, you can
tailor the Microsoft Teams notifications of each project to match your teams'
needs. You can have Cypress Cloud post run results for a specific project.

1. Select your organization in the organization switcher.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/select-cypress-organization.jpg"
     alt="Select an organization"
     width={500}
   />

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/select-cypress-project.jpg"
     alt="Select a project"
     width={600}
   />
3. Go to the project's settings page.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/select-project-settings.jpg"
     alt="Visit project settings"
     width={400}
   />
4. Scroll down and click **Add Teams webhook** in the **Microsoft Teams**
   section.
