## Enable the Microsoft Teams integration

:::caution

<strong>Ownership Requirements</strong>

In order to enable the Cypress integration for Microsoft Teams, you must be an
admin or owner of both your Cypress Cloud organization and your Microsoft Teams
workspace.

:::

### Per-organization configuration (all projects)

1. Go to Cypress Cloud
   [Organizations page](https://cloud.cypress.io/organizations) or open the
   organization switcher.
2. Select the organization you wish to integrate with Microsoft Teams.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/select-cypress-organization.jpg"
     alt="Select an organization"
     width={600}
   />

3. Visit the selected organization's **Integrations** page via the side
   navigation.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/navigate-to-organization-integrations.jpg"
     alt="Install Cypress Microsoft Teams from Integrations"
     width={600}
   />

4. Click the **Enable** button in the Microsoft Teams section.

   <DocsImage

     alt="Click enable under Microsoft Teams Integration"
     width={1000}
   />

5. You'll navigate to a window that manages webhooks as a way for Cypress Cloud
   to communicate with Microsoft Teams.

   First, you must configure an Incoming Webhook to a Teams channel. For more
   information on that, see
   [Microsoft Teams - Create Incoming Webhooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet#create-incoming-webhooks-1).

   Then, add the Teams webhook to your Cypress Cloud Organization, choosing the
   types of notifications your team should receive.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/guides/cloud/integrations/add-org-webhook.jpg"
     alt="Click enable under Microsoft Teams Integration"
     width={600}
   />

   Once you've configured and added your webhooks, the installation is complete!
   Cypress Cloud will post run results for **all** projects in your organization
   to the specified Microsoft Teams channel.

#### Remove a webhook

You can have Cypress Cloud stop posting notifications to a channel. You cannot
delete the global notification channels from a project.

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page for the project with the installed
   integration.
2. Scroll down to the **Microsoft Teams** section.
3. Under **Actions**, select **Delete** for each webhook you want deleted.

### Per-project configuration

If your organization has multiple teams working on separate projects, you can
tailor the Microsoft Teams notifications of each project to match your teams'
needs. You can have Cypress Cloud post run results for a specific project.

1. Select your organization in the organization switcher.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/select-cypress-organization.jpg"
     alt="Select an organization"
     width={600}

     width={1000}
   />
