## User requests

Users can "request" access to a given organization. If a developer on your team
has access to Cypress and your project's source code - they can request to be
given access to your organization. This means instead of you having to invite
team members up front, they can request access and you can choose to accept or
deny them access.

## User updates

To change a user email, an **Owner** or **Admin** can invite the new user/email
address and delete the previous user/email address.

Update the billing email address via the **Billing & Usage** page within
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) or by contacting
[billing@cypress.io](mailto:billing@cypress.io) directly.
