- `projectId` and Record Key identification and usage
- Project settings and integrations

:::

## Identification

Cypress uses your [projectId](#Project-ID) and [Record Key](#Record-key)
together to uniquely identify projects.

### Project ID

Once you set up your project to record, we generate a unique `projectId` for
your project and automatically insert it into your Cypress configuration file.

#### The `projectId` is a 6 character string in your Cypress configuration

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
{
  projectId: 'a7bq2k',
}
```

:::

This helps us uniquely identify your project. If you manually alter this,
**Cypress will no longer be able to identify your project or find the recorded
builds for it**.

If you're using source control, we recommend that you check your Cypress
configuration file, including the `projectId`, into source control. If you don't
want your `projectId` visible in your source code you can set it as an
environment variable using the name `CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID`. The exact mechanism
for doing so depends on your system but could be something like:

```shell
export CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID={projectId}
```

### Record key

The record key is used to authenticate that your project is _allowed_ to record
tests to Cypress Cloud. As long as your record key stays _private_, no one will
be able to record test runs for your project - even if they have your
`projectId`.

Think of your record key as the key that enables you to _write and create_ runs.
However, it has nothing to do with being able to _read or see_ runs once they
are recorded.

:::caution

<strong>Exposing a record key</strong>

Anyone that has access to both the `projectId` and the record key of a project
can record runs to that organization's project in Cypress Cloud.

**You would not want people outside of your team running tests because:**

1. **This could drive up the number of tests you've run.** Since Cypress bills
   based on the number of recorded tests - this means they can use up all
   allotted tests and there would be consequences to that.
2. **They can write any data they want to your Cypress Cloud.** They could edit
   the test suite so that recorded tests record different things than the
   project's original intent. This could including visiting different websites
   and generating videos of visiting those websites, for example.

If a record key is exposed you should [delete it](#Delete-record-key) and
[create a new record key](#Create-new-record-key). Deleted keys will be invalid;
If a project is run with a deleted key it will not be able to record.

You can set your record key as an environment variable to help protect it. Learn
more [here](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Environment-variables).

:::

Once you're set up to record test runs, we automatically generate a _Record Key_
for the project.

#### A record key is a GUID that looks like this

```text
f4466038-70c2-4688-9ed9-106bf013cd73
```

You can create multiple Record Keys for a project, or delete existing ones from
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud).

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/projects/record-keys-in-project-settings-dashboard.jpg"
  alt="Record key in project settings"
/>

You can also find your Record Key inside of the _Settings_ tab in the Cypress
App.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/projects/record-key-desktop-gui.jpg"
  alt="Record Key in Configuration Tab"
/>

#### Create new record key

1. Go to your organization's projects page.
2. Select the project you want to change access to.
3. Go to the project's **Settings** page.
4. Here you will see a **Record Keys** section
5. Click **Create New Key**. A new key will be automatically generated for your
   project.

#### Delete record key

1. Go to your organization's projects page.
2. Select the project you want to change access to.
3. Go to the project's **Settings** page.
4. Here you will see a **Record Keys** section
5. Click **Delete** beside the record key you want to delete.

## Project settings

### Access to Runs

Visit your project settings to see who has access to your project's runs.

#### Public vs Private

- **Public** means that anyone can see the recorded test runs for the project.
  It is similar to how public projects on GitHub, Travis CI, or CircleCI are
  handled. Anyone who knows your `projectId` will be able to see the recorded
  runs for public projects.

- **Private** means that only [users](/guides/cloud/users) you invite to your
  [organization](/guides/cloud/organizations) can see its recorded runs. Even if
  someone knows your `projectId`, they will not have access to your runs unless
  you have invited them.

#### Change project access

1. Go to your organization's projects page.
2. Select the project you want to change access to.
3. Go to the project's **Settings** page.
4. Here you will see a section displaying **Access**. Choose the appropriate
   access you'd like to assign.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/guides/cloud/projects/access-to-runs.jpg"
     alt="access-to-runs"
   />

### Smart Orchestration

#### Spec Prioritization & Auto Cancellation

Toggle Spec Prioritization and/or adjust the number of test failures before auto
canceling a run.

Learn more about [Smart Orchestration](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration).

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization-active.png"
  alt="Run completion delay settings"
/>

### Parallelization

#### Run completion delay

You can edit the number of seconds that a run will wait for new groups to join
before transitioning to 'completed'. See our
[parallelization guide](/guides/guides/parallelization#Run-completion-delay) to
learn more.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/projects/run-completion-delay.jpg"
  alt="Run completion delay settings"
/>

### Transfer ownership

#### Transfer project to other user or organization

You can transfer projects that you own to another
[organization](/guides/cloud/organizations) you are a part of or to another user
in the organization. Projects can only be transferred from
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud).

1. Select your organization in the organization switcher.
2. Select the project you wish to transfer.
3. Go to the project's **Settings** page.
4. Scroll down to the **Transfer Ownership** section and click **Transfer
   Ownership**.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/guides/cloud/projects/transfer-ownership-button.jpg"
     alt="Transfer ownership button"
   />
5. Select the user or organization, then click **Transfer**.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/guides/cloud/projects/transfer-ownership-of-project-dialog.jpg"
     alt="Transfer Project dialog"
     width="80%"
   />

#### Cancel project transfer

Upon transferring, you can cancel the transfer at any time by visiting the
organization's projects and clicking **Cancel Transfer**.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/projects/cancel-transfer-of-project.jpg"
  alt="Cancel pending transfer of project"
/>

#### Accept or reject transferred project

When a project is transferred to you, you will receive an email notifying you.
You will be able to accept or reject the transferred project by clicking the
notification in the sidebar and clicking 'Accept' or 'Reject'.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/projects/accept-or-reject-transfer-of-project.jpg"
  alt="Accept or reject a transferred project"
/>

### Delete Project

You can delete projects you own. This will also delete all of their recorded
test runs. Deleting projects can only be done from
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud).

1. Select your organization in the organization switcher.
2. Select the project you want to remove.
3. Go to the project's **Settings** page.
4. At the very bottom of the Settings page click the **Remove Project** button.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/remove-project-dialog.png"
     alt="Delete project dialog"
     width="80%"
   />
5. Confirm that you want to delete the project by clicking **Yes, Remove
   Project**.

### README Badges

README badges allow you to increase visibility of your project's test status and
test count to other developers viewing your project's README file.

#### Create a README badge

1. In your Cypress Cloud account, select the project for which you'd like to add
   a badge.
2. On the Project Settings page, scroll down to the README Badges section and
   click “Configure Badge”.

:::caution

**Note**: README badges are currently only available for public projects.

:::

3. A configuration modal will appear. The Project ID will be pre-filled with the
   ID associated with the project you selected. You can choose to designate a
   specific branch, or leave this field blank to always use the latest build in
   the project.
4. Next, style your badge. Flat is the default styling and is most commonly
   used, but 5 style options are available.
5. Select the badge type to change the amount and type of information that's
   displayed. Simple status will show only whether tests are passing or failing.
   Detailed status will show the number of tests that were passed, failed, or
   skipped. Test count will show how many tests are included in your project.
6. Once you've selected all your settings, check out the preview and make sure
   everything looks just the way you like it.
7. 🎉 Your badge is ready to be embedded. Copy the markdown at the bottom of the
   Configure Badge modal, and embed it in your project's README file for
   everyone to see!
