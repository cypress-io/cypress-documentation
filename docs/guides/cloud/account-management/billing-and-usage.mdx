## Open Source Plan

To support the community, we provide the Open Source (OSS) plan to take
advantage of Cypress Cloud with unlimited test runs. To qualify, all Projects in
your Organization must meet the following criteria:

- Be a non-commercial entity
- Be [Public](https://on.cypress.io/projects#Change-project-access) in Cypress
  Cloud
- Your Project source code is available in a public location with an
  [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses)
- Record minimum of 500
  [tests](https://on.cypress.io/cloud-faq#What-counts-as-a-test-result) included
  with the [Free Plan](https://www.cypress.io/pricing)
