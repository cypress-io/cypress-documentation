<DocsImage src="/img/guides/cloud/sso/enterprise-SSO-SAML.png" alt="SAML SSO" />

1. Log into the admin interface for your identity provider.
1. Work through the setup wizard supplying the information requested:

- **App name:** `Cypress Cloud`
- **App logo:** [Cypress logo download](https://on.cypress.io/logo)

##### **Azure AD**

Cypress Cloud can integrate with your identity provider via Azure AD. In

[configuring an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

1. Log into the Azure portal and create a new Application.

- **App logo:** [Cypress logo download](https://on.cypress.io/logo)
- **Login URL:** Collect the URL provided by Cypress Cloud

1. Collect the `Client ID` for your application provided in the Application
   overview page.
1. Go to **Certificates and Secrets** in your Azure Application and create a new
   secret that does not expire. Copy this newly-created secret and paste it in
   the `Azure Client Secret` field in Cypress Cloud.
1. Under **API Permissions** in Azure AD, ensure the application has access to
   **User.Read** permissions
1. Enter the domain used for your Active Directory, as well as the list of SSO
   domains you wish to allow user to authenticate with, in Cypress Cloud. This
   is used for SSO discovery from the login screen.
1. [Save Configuration](#Save-Configuration).

#### Save Configuration

Return to Cypress Cloud and click **Save Configuration**. Cypress Cloud will
attempt to authenticate.

ðŸŽ‰ Your integration is now complete! You can invite all of the users in your
organization to sign in through your SSO provider.

#### Notes

- Once SSO is successfully set up, users will need to be invited via your SSO
  provider, as the Cypress Cloud invitation option will be disabled.
- All SSO Users are initially added with the
  [User Role](/guides/cloud/account-management/users#User-roles) of Member. If a
  User needs different User Role permissions, this can be changed via Cypress
  Cloud by a current member with the role of Owner or Admin.
- SSO users are separate accounts from Google/GitHub or email/password users. If
  there are duplicate users, duplicates can be removed by any
  [Owner or Admin](/guides/cloud/account-management/users#User-roles).
