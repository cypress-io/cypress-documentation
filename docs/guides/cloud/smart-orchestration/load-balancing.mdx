Optimize CI resources and minimize test duration by intelligently prioritizing running of test spec files during parallelization.

## Balance strategy

Cypress will automatically balance your spec files across the available machines
in your CI provider. Cypress calculates which spec file to run based on the data
collected from previous runs. This ensures that your spec files run as fast as
possible, with no need for manual configuration.

As more and more tests are recorded to Cypress Cloud, Cypress can better predict
how long a given spec file will take to run. To prevent irrelevant data from
affecting the duration prediction, Cypress doesn't use old historical run data
regarding the spec file.

### Spec duration history analysis

  alt="Spec duration forecasting"

With a duration estimation for each spec file of a test run, Cypress can
distribute spec files to available CI resources in descending order of spec run
duration. In this manner, the most time-consuming specs start first which
minimizes the overall test run duration.

:::info

Duration estimation is done separately for every browser the spec file was
tested against. This is helpful since performance characteristics vary by
browser, and therefore it is perfectly acceptable to see different duration
estimates for each browser a spec file was tested against.
