Cypress Cloud provides four distinct Smart Orchestration features for use in CI
to speed up test runs, accelerate debugging workflows, and reduce costs:

- [Parallelization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization): Reduce
  test duration by running multiple test spec files simultaneously across
  available CI machines.
- [Load Balancing](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/load-balancing): Optimize
  CI resources and minimize test duration by intelligently prioritizing running
  of test spec files during parallelization.
- [Spec Prioritization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization):
  Quickly verify that your latest changes fixed a build by prioritizing the
  specs that failed in the previous Cypress run.
- [Auto Cancellation](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/auto-run-cancellation):
  Save on CI resources by automatically canceling a Cypress run upon the first
  test failure.
