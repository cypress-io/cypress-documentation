Cypress Cloud provides four distinct Smart Orchestration features for use in CI
to speed up test runs, accelerate debugging workflows, and reduce costs:

- [Parallelization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization): Reduce test duration by
  running multiple test spec files simultaneously across available CI machines.
- [Load Balancing](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/load-balancing): Optimize CI
  resources and minimize test duration by intelligently prioritizing running of
  test spec files during parallelization.
- [Spec Prioritization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization): Quickly verify that your latest
  changes fixed a build by prioritizing the specs that failed in the previous
  Cypress run.
- [Run Cancellation](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation): Save on CI resources by automatically
  canceling a Cypress run upon the first test failure.
