It is often helpful to be **aware of test failures earlier within a CI test run
so that debugging and iterations can resume and progress much faster**. Being
able to catch issues sooner within the CI process can save valuable time in
troubleshooting failures and deploying fixes.

<Icon name="graduation-cap" /> **Consider the Scenario**

For example, you have a test suite consisting of several spec files that take 30
minutes to execute, but failures start to occur within one spec at the 20 minute
marker. A subsequent code change aimed at resolving the issue will have to be
validated after running the CI build and waiting 20 minutes. This process and
waiting continues until the issue is fixed.

By running failed specs first, the issues can be surfaced earlier and reduce
that 20 minute wait to potentially a few minutes. **Considering that a test
suite has multiple spec files, this orchestration strategy will always save
time.**

### Activate Spec Prioritization in Cypress Cloud

:::tip

<Icon name="star" /> **Premium Cypress Cloud Feature**

**Spec Prioritization** is a _Smart Orchestration_ feature available to users
with a
[Business or Enterprise tier Cypress Cloud plan](https://cypress.io/pricing).
Wondering if upgrading your Team tier subscription is worth it? Check out the
[recommendations](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs#Recommendations) on the run
overview page to see how much time we predict these features would save you.

:::

Spec Prioritization is a _Smart Orchestration_ feature that is managed within a
project's settings.

To enable or disable this feature at the Project level (must be an admin user):

1. Select the desired project within Projects view to visit Cypress Cloud.
2. Click "Project Settings" with the right-hand sidebar.
3. Scroll to the Smart Orchestration section within Project Settings page.
4. Toggle "Spec Prioritization".

<strong>CI Tip: Reduce Costs</strong>

Note that Spec Prioritization **alone** will not save time as it purely alters
the order in which specs are run. However, when used in tandem with
[Auto Cancellation](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation) it can
result in shorter test runs due to cancellation being triggered earlier, leading
to significantly reduced CI costs.
