Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines are typically costly processes that can
demand significant compute time. **When a test failure occurs in CI, it often
does not make sense to continue running the remainder of a test suite** since
the process has to start again upon merging of subsequent fixes and other code
changes. When Auto Cancellation is enabled, once the number of failed tests goes
over a preset threshold, the entire test run is canceled. Note that any
in-progress specs will continue to run to completion.

<Icon name="check" /> **Benefits**

Canceling an **entire** test run, even if parallelized, upon the first test
failure will:

1. **Save time**. Resolve test outcomes faster.
2. **Reduce CI costs**. These cost savings can be significant for large test
   suites.
3. **Free-up CI resources** for validating fixes, and helping other users.

### Activate Auto Cancellation in Cypress Cloud

:::tip

<Icon name="star" /> **Premium Cypress Cloud Feature**

**Auto Cancellation** is a _Smart Orchestration_ feature available to users with
a [Business or Enterprise tier Cypress Cloud plan](https://cypress.io/pricing).
Wondering if upgrading your Team tier subscription is worth it? Check out the
[recommendations](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs#Recommendations) on the run
overview page to see how much time we predict these features would save you.

:::

Auto Cancellation is a _Smart Orchestration_ feature that is managed within a
project's settings.

:::info

<strong>Consideration for Teams</strong>

If your development, testing, or QA teams operate in a highly collaborative
workflow where multiple people are working on various test failures at the same
time, it may make sense to increase the failures threshold to surface more failures on each test run.

:::

To enable or disable this feature at the Project level (must be an admin user):

1. Select the desired project within Projects view to visit Cypress Cloud.
2. Click "Project Settings" with the right-hand sidebar.
3. Scroll to the Smart Orchestration section within Project Settings page.
4. Toggle "Auto Cancellation".
5. Set the "failures before auto canceling" threshold (or just leave it at the
   default value of 1).

<strong>CI Tip: Save Time</strong>

In addition to Auto Cancellation, consider reducing CI costs further by enabling
[Spec Prioritization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization) to
surface test failures earlier in the run, and reduce the time it takes to fix
issues and deploy changes.

### Specifying failures before auto canceling in the CLI

:::info

The `auto-cancel-after-failures` flag in the CLI is only available in Cypress
`12.6.0` and later. Including the flag in an older version will throw an error.

:::

With the Cypress CLI, you can specify the number of test failures to execute
before canceling the run via a command flag. This allows more granular control
of Auto Cancellation on a per-run basis.

Some common use cases for doing so might be:

- Setting a lower-than-normal value on dev environments to fail a test suite
  early for faster feedback
- Disabling Auto Cancellation on important branches that need the full test
  suite to run every time
- Overriding the project value on a case-by-case basis

Specifying the flag will override the project setting in Cypress Cloud, and not
specifying it will default to the value in the project settings.

To set it, pass the `--auto-cancel-after-failures` flag to the `cypress run`
command, and give it a numeric value:

```bash
npx cypress run --record --key <<your_record_key>> --auto-cancel-after-failures 1
```

You can also specify `false` for the value to disable Auto Cancellation for the
run:

```bash
npx cypress run --record --key <<your_record_key>> --auto-cancel-after-failures false
```

For more info on passing CLI flags, see our guide on the
[Cypress Command Line](/guides/guides/command-line).
