- How to set up your project to record in Cypress Cloud
- How to record and view your first run with your record key

:::

When you configure the open source Cypress app to record tests to Cypress Cloud,
you'll see data from your project's latest recorded runs.

You typically want to record when running tests in
[Continuous Integration](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction), but you
can also record your tests when running locally.

:::tip

[install](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) and
[open](/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app) the Cypress app to get started
recording!

## Setup

### Set up a project to record

1. Click on the **Runs** tab of your project within
   [Cypress](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app).
2. Click **Connect to Cypress Cloud**.
3. You will need to log in to record your tests, so you'll be prompted to log in
   to Cypress Cloud here if you haven't already done so.

     alt="Connect to Cloud"
   />
4. Choose who owns the project. You can personally own it or select an
   organization you're a member of. If you don't have any organizations, click
   **Manage organizations**. Organizations work just like they do in GitHub and
   enable you to separate your personal and work projects.
   [Read more about organizations](/guides/cloud/organizations).

     alt="Choose an Organization"
   />
5. If you don't have any existing projects, you'll have the opportunity to
   create a new one here. If you have existing projects and want to create a new
   one, you can click **Create new** to make a new one.

   - Fill in the name of your project (this is only for display purposes and can
     be changed later).
   - Choose whether this project is Public or Private.

See more about [Public-vs-Private project settings](projects#Public-vs-Private).

  alt="Create a New Project"
/>

6. Alternatively, if you've already created a project in Cypress Cloud, you can
   link your project by selecting it from the dropdown. Make sure to select a
   clean project that has not previously been linked to an existing project.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/guides/cloud/projects/setup-a-project-4.jpg"
     alt="Choose a Project"
   />
7. Click **Setup Project**.
8. Now you should see a view explaining how to record your first run with your
   record key.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/guides/cloud/projects/setup-a-project-5.jpg"
     alt="Record Instructions"
   />
9. After setting up your project, Cypress inserts a unique
   [projectId](#Identification) into your Cypress configuration file. If you're
   using source control, we recommend that you check your configuration file,
   including the `projectId`, into source control.
10. Within [Continuous Integration](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction)
    or from your local computer's terminal, pass the displayed
    [Record Key](#Identification) while running the
    [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) command.

    Provide record key directly:

    ```shell
    cypress run --record --key <record key>
    ```

    Or set record key as environment variable:

    ```shell
    export CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY=<record key>
    ```

    ```shell
    cypress run --record
    ```

### View your recorded run

🎉 Your tests are now recording! As soon as tests finish running, you will see
them in [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) and in the _Runs_ tab of
[Cypress](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app).
