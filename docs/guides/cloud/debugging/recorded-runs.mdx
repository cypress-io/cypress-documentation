Recorded runs capture the results from your test runs. Each specific area of
this highly informative view is described below.

:::tip

&#8239<Icon name="check-circle" color="green" /> If you haven't set up your
project to record, [read here](/guides/cloud/getting-started#Setup).

:::

## Latest Runs

The Project entry point provides a high-level overview of your most recent runs.
This view presents a paginated summary of runs which are filterable and can be
manually refreshed in the top right corner.

## Run Details

On navigating to a specific run, you are presented with the Run Details page.
This page consists of a common header and four tabbed sub-pages,
[Overview](#Overview-tab), [Test Results](#Test-Results-tab),
[Specs](#Specs-tab), and [Errors](#Errors-tab).

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/run-details-page.png"
  alt="Run Details page"
/>

### Run header

At the left side of the header is important metadata about the run, including
git author and branch
([if available](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information)),
run time and duration, CI data and more. Clicking on the three dots to the right
of this section displays additional metadata, including browsers and operating
systems used, the Cypress version, and what
[Smart Orchestration](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/overview) settings were
active.

At the right of the header are a set of indicators showing the number of
[flaky](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management), skipped, pending, passed, and
failed tests in this run. Clicking any of these takes you to the
[Test Results](#Test-Results-tab) tab with results filtered by the clicked
status.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/run-details-header.png"
  alt="Run details header"
/>

### Run in progress panel

If the selected run is currently in progress, an additional panel will be shown
under the Run Header with a progress indicator and an action link to
[cancel the run](#Run-cancellation).

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/run-in-progress-panel.png"
  alt="Run in progress panel"
/>

## Overview tab

By default the Run Details page will be open to the Overview tab. Here you can
see the run metrics we consider most critical.

### Run duration

This graph visualizes how long your tests took to run compared to previous runs,
with the currently selected run highlighted. Run status is indicated by the
color of the bars, which may be filtered by status with the dropdown to the top
right of that graph. Hovering over a run displays a popover with more
information.

At the bottom of the run duration graph you may see one or more blue boxes.
These represent points in time when configuration settings were changed,
possibly impacting test performance. Hovering over them reveals the specific
changes made.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/run-duration.png"
  alt="Run duration panel"
/>

### Recommendations

To the right of the run duration graph you may see a box with our
recommendations for improving the performance of your test suite. Our
[Smart Orchestration](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/overview) features can
help you run fewer, more relevant, and faster tests, depending on the details of
your test suite.

The algorithm we use to calculate the details of these recommendations is a
sophisticated and quite detailed model of your test suite, but fundamentally we
look at up to 100 of your most recent tests and simulate what those test runs
would have looked like with different Smart Orchestration configurations. From
there we calculate a figure totalling the differences in duration between the
simulated tests and the actual tests as they happened.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/recommendations.png"
  alt="Recommendations"
/>

### Tests for Review

The Tests for Review panel consolidates disparate test results into a single
view, focusing attention on the specs producing the most relevant results.

It orders results by:

- **Failed** - when a failure occurred in the test or a hook associated with the
  test
- **Flaky** - when a test failed one or more attempts before finally passing
- **Modified** - when the test body has changed from a previously recorded tests

The panel shows these tests broken down by spec, with a badge clearly indicating the reason the result was considered notable. Access run artifacts with a mouse hover to quickly expose the [Test Replay](/guides/cloud/debugging/test-replay) or [screenshots](/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos#Screenshots),
[videos](/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos#Videos) and CI logs generated by this test.

Clicking on a specific test opens the
[test detail sidebar](#Test-detail-sidebar).

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/tests-for-review.png"
  alt="Tests for Review"
/>

## Test Results tab

On the Test Results tab, detailed results for the entire test run can be browsed
and examined. At the top of the page are dropdowns for you to sort and filter
results by a wide range of metrics, like
[test statuses](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-statuses)
or [flaky tests](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management).

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/test-results.png"
  alt="Test Results tab"
/>

## Specs tab

Another way to look at your run is by "zooming out" to the spec file level,
which is the purpose of the Specs tab. Remember, a spec file is a single file
that can contain one or more test(s).

This tab lets you view spec results collected into
[run groups](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization#Grouping-test-runs).
You can switch between views, focusing either on run order, spec duration or
[parallelization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization) (per
machine) using the Views button bar in the top right.

In all of these views, spec results may be clicked to open those tests in the
Test Results tab.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/specs-view-switcher.png"
  alt="Specs view switcher"
/>

### Timeline View

The Timeline View charts your spec files as they ran relative to each other.
This is especially helpful when you want to visualize how your tests ran in
[parallel](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization).

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/specs-timeline.png"
  alt="Specs Timeline View"
/>

### Bar Chart View

The Bar Chart View charts the lengths of each spec file. This view is helpful to
determine which spec files are using up a lot of run time and could be split up
or simplified.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/specs-bar-chart.png"
  alt="Specs Bar Chart View"
/>

### Machines View

If your tests are parallelized, the Machines View shows which and how many specs
were run on each parallel process. This view lets you see how work is being
distributed, and provides hard data for decisions about increasing or decreasing
your CI [parallelization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization)
capacity.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/specs-machines.png"
  alt="Specs Machines View"
/>

## Errors tab

The Errors tab simply aggregates any errors thrown during tests in this run.
Expanding specific errors gives more information and a link through to the
[test detail sidebar](#Test-detail-sidebar).

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/errors.png" alt="Errors tab" />

## Test detail sidebar

Every test in the run has all its details surfaced in a special sidebar. This
sidebar may contain all or fewer of the sections detailed below. In addition it
may also contain details of runtime environment, failure and flake rates over
time, performance breakdowns, listings of the test code itself, and more.

### Header

Contains the title of the failed test, and the spec it's located in. May also
have labels indicating test status or other pertinent information, and shortcuts
to raise tickets on integrated project management systems or view artifacts.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/sidebar-header.png"
  alt="Test sidebar header"
/>

### Attempts and errors

Stack traces, error message, and point-of-failure code frames for each attempt
of a test. View or debug artifacts of each particular attempt.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/sidebar-errors.png"
  alt="Test sidebar attempts and errors"
/>

### Previous runs

A graphical history of previous runs of this test, indicating failures and
successes on the current branch.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/sidebar-previous-runs.png"
  alt="Test sidebar previous Runs"
/>

### Artifacts

[Test Replay](/guides/cloud/debugging/test-replay) to view the
test as it executed in CI with full debug capability.

[Screenshots](/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos#Screenshots),
[videos](/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos#Videos) and CI logs generated by
this test. Both screenshots taken during failures and screenshots taken using
the [`cy.screenshot()`](/api/commands/screenshot) command will show up here.
Video can be downloaded.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/sidebar-artifacts.png"
  alt="Test sidebar artifacts"
/>

CI logs from the Cypress standard output include details and summaries of your
tests for each spec file based on the [reporter](/guides/tooling/reporters) you
have set. By default it is the `spec` reporter.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/standard-output-of-recorded-test-run.png"
  alt="standard output"
/>

### Test Code History

Shows git commits that included changes to the current test, providing insights
into the development of this test, helping to diagnose test failures, and track
down regressions. Expanding a specific commit shows the diff at that point in
time.

Note that the diff is based on the state of the code **after** transpilation,
since we are not currently collecting source maps.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/sidebar-test-code-history.png"
  alt="Test sidebar code history"
/>

## Run cancellation

You can cancel a run currently in progress from Cypress Cloud. Runs can only be
canceled by members of the project.

### To cancel a run

- Click on a run in progress from the run list
- Click on **<Icon name="ban" /> Cancel run** in the upper-right corner of the
  run details page
- Click **Yes, cancel this run** to confirm. **Note: this cannot be undone**

### What happens when a run is canceled?

- The run status will update to canceled.
- A message will appear on the run details page showing the time of cancellation
  and the user that canceled the run.
- The run will display as **Canceled** in the associated GitHub pull request if
  [GitHub Integration](/guides/cloud/integrations/source-control/github) is
  enabled.
- Any tests recorded to completion will be available to view in the run details
  page.
- Any tests recorded to completion will still count towards your monthly test
  results limit.
- If you have Analytics enabled, canceled runs will appear in the
  [Runs over time](/guides/cloud/analytics#Run-status) chart.
- Any incomplete calls to
  [cypress run --record](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) for the run
  will be marked as canceled and not run.
- Any existing calls to
  [cypress run --record](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) for the run
  will exit with an error like below.

  <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/cancel-run-error.png" alt="cancel-run-error" />

:::tip

&#8239<Icon name="check-circle" color="green" /> See our [Run Cancellation](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation) guide to learn how to improve developer resolution time, reduce your monthly CI bill and free up CI resources with `Auto Cancellation`.

:::

## Archive run

Runs that have been canceled or are in an errored state can be archived from
Cypress Cloud.

### To archive a run

- In the cancellation or error message, click **Archive this run**.
  <DocsImage
    src="/img/dashboard/archive-run-within-cancelation-msg.png"
    alt="cancel-run-error"
  />

### What happens when a run is archived?

- The archived run will no longer display in the runs list or
  [Analytics](/guides/cloud/analytics) reporting.
- Archived runs can be accessed by the URL to that run. The format is:
  `https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/{project ID}/runs/{run number}`
- Any tests recorded to Cypress Cloud will still count towards your monthly test
  results limit, even when it has been archived.

### To restore an archived run

- Visit the archived run. The archived run can be accessed by the URL of the
  run. The format is:
  `https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/{project ID}/runs/{run number}`
- Click **<Icon name="history" /> Restore from archive**
  <DocsImage
    src="/img/dashboard/restore-from-archive.png"
    alt="restore-from-archive"
  />

## Cypress App

### Specs

For even more visibility into your test results, information about recent runs
is surfaced in the [Cypress app](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app). Aggregate
results of your latest runs are shown on the
[Specs](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Specs) page while more detailed
information about specific runs can be found on the
[Runs](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Runs) page.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/spec-explorer.png"
  alt="Specs"
/>

### Runs

This screen shows detailed information about the most recently recorded
[test runs](#Latest-Runs) to Cypress Cloud, showing the latest first.

The [Runs](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Runs) page uses Git to show runs
for your branch. If no runs are found for your current branch, all runs for your
project are shown as a fallback. The title of each run is taken from the
[git commit message](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/git-commit-message-simply-explained)
for that change, and clicking on it will take you to the corresponding run page
in Cypress Cloud.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/recorded-runs.jpg"
  alt="Recorded Runs"
/>

### Debug

The [Debug](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Debug) page allows you to easily
debug failed CI test runs from within the Cypress app. From this page, you can
review, rerun, and debug failed CI test runs that are recorded to Cypress
Cloud - all without leaving the Cypress app.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/debug-page.png"
  alt="Debug"
/>

### Notifications

Cypress Cloud can notify you about recorded test runs on your branch directly in
the app through system notifications.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/app-notification.jpg"
  alt="App notification on macOS"
/>

Clicking the notification will take you to the [debug](#Debug) page in the
Cypress app.

:::info

In-app notifications are available in Cypress `v12.17.0` and above and requires
macOS or Linux. Windows support is coming soon.

:::

#### Configure Notifications

To enable notifications, in the Cypress app, go to Settings, then down to Device
Settings, and click the **Enable desktop notifications** button. Your system may
then prompt you to allow notifications.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/enable-notifications.jpg"
  alt="Enable notifications"
/>

You can receive notifications for the following events:

- When a recorded run starts on your current commit in Cypress Cloud
- When a recorded run starts to fail on your current commit in Cypress Cloud
- And when a recorded run completes on your current commit in Cypress Cloud,
  which you can customize the events to notify you when a run passes, fails, is
  canceled or has an error.

:::note

Note: You will only receive notifications for runs that are running on the same
commit that your current branch's head is on locally.

:::

Click the **Send test notification** button to test that notifications are
working properly on your system.

#### Troubleshooting Notifications

If you are not receiving notifications, please check the following:

- That the recorded run is being recorded to Cypress Cloud.
- In your system settings, make sure that notifications are enabled for the
  Cypress app.
- That your local project is currently on the git commit that the test run being
  recorded is sending notifications for.
