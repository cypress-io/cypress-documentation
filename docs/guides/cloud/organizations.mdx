Organizations are used to group projects and manage access to those projects.

<DocsImage

  alt="Organizations"
  width-600
/>

## Features

- Create projects
- Invite users
- Transfer projects
- Pay for all of your projects usage.

### Organization ID

An Organization's ID is a unique identifier in
[UUID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) format that can be found under the
"Organization settings" section of Cypress Cloud. This ID is used frequently by
the Support, Success, and Sales teams to reference an Organization.

To locate your Organization's ID, go to "Organization settings" then
Organization ID. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the ID for easy sharing
with Cypress teams.

## Managing Organizations

### Create Org

You can create an organization from within
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) by opening the organization
switcher and clicking **<Icon name="plus" /> Create new organization**.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/create-org.png"
  alt="Create new organization"
  width-600
/>

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/add-organization-dialog.png"
  alt="Add Organization dialog"
  width-600
/>

### Personal Org

In the past, every user of Cypress was given a personal organization - named
after you. You cannot delete or edit the name of this personal organization,
however you can convert it to a professional organization.

New users will no longer have a personal organization created for them
automatically.

#### Convert to professional org

If you've already set up your projects, users, and billing on your personal
organization, you can convert it to a professional organization via the
**Organization settings** page.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/convert-to-professional-org-button.jpg"
  alt="Convert org for billing"
/>

Click the **Convert organization** button, provide a name for the organization,
and hit **Convert organization**. This will do two things:

1. It will upgrade your personal organization to a new named organization. All
   of your projects, users, and billing information will carry over to this new
   organization.
2. We'll create a new, empty personal organization so you always have a place to
   keep your side projects and experiments!

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/convert-to-professional-org-modal.jpg"
  alt="Convert org to new org"
  width-600
/>

### Delete Org

You can delete organizations that you own as long as they do not have any
projects in the organization. You must first transfer ownership of your projects
to another organization before you can delete the organization.

  src="/img/dashboard/remove-organization-dialog.png"
  alt="Delete Organization"
/>

## Billing & Usage

### Open Source Plan

To support the community, we provide the Open Source (OSS) plan to take
advantage of Cypress Cloud with unlimited test runs. To qualify, all Projects in
your Organization must meet the following criteria:

- Be a non-commercial entity
- Be [Public](https://on.cypress.io/projects#Change-project-access) in Cypress
  Cloud
- Your Project source code is available in a public location with an
  [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses)
- Record minimum of 500
  [tests](https://on.cypress.io/cloud-faq#What-counts-as-a-test-result) included
  with the [Free Plan](https://www.cypress.io/pricing)

### Requesting OSS plan for an Org

Follow the following process to request an OSS plan:

1. [Login](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) to the Cypress Dashboard, or
   [create an account](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) if you are a new user.

   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/oss-plan-1-login.png"
     alt="Login or Create Account"
   />

2. Go the [Organizations page](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard/organizations) to
   select the Organization you want to associate with an OSS plan. If you have
   no Organizations, you can create one by clicking the **+ Add Organization**
   button.

1. Log into your Okta dashboard and head to the **Admin** section.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/organizations/okta-admin-cypress-sso-setup.png"
     alt="Okta Admin"

   Cypress Cloud needs the information provided here:

- Copy the Identity Provider Single sign-on URL to Cypress Cloud.
- Download the certificate and upload that to Cypress Cloud. {' '}
  <DocsImage
    src="/img/dashboard/organizations/okta-download-certificate-for-cypress-dashboard.png"
    alt="Download Certificate"
  />

1. Navigate to the **Assignments** tab and grant your users access to Cypress
   Cloud.
1. [Save Configuration](#Save-Configuration).

##### **SAML**

Cypress Cloud can integrate with your identity provider via SAML. In addition to
the documentation below, refer to your provider's official documentation for
configuring a SAML integration.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/organizations/enterprise-SSO-SAML.png"
  alt="SAML SSO"
/>

1. Log into the admin interface for your identity provider.
1. Work through the setup wizard supplying the information requested:

- **App name:** `Cypress Cloud`
- **App logo:** [Cypress logo download](https://on.cypress.io/logo)
- **Single sign on URL:** Collect the URL provided by Cypress Cloud
- **Audience URI:** Collect the URI provided by Cypress Cloud
- Add a custom mapping of **AttributeStatements** with the following:
  - `User.Email`: User's email
  - `User.FirstName`: User's first name
  - `User.LastName`: User's last name

1. Collect the sign-on URL and certificate from your identity provider. Supply
   that to Cypress Cloud.
1. [Save Configuration](#Save-Configuration).

##### **Azure AD**

Cypress Cloud can integrate with your identity provider via Azure AD. In
addition to the documentation below, refer to the Microsoft Guides for
[configuring an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

1. Log into the Azure portal and create a new Application.
1. Work through the application setup, supplying the following information when
   requested:

- **App name:** `Cypress Cloud`
- **App logo:** [Cypress logo download](https://on.cypress.io/logo)
- **Login URL:** Collect the URL provided by Cypress Cloud

1. Collect the `Client ID` for your application provided in the Application
   overview page.
1. Go to **Certificates and Secrets** in your Azure Application and create a new
   secret that does not expire. Copy this newly-created secret and paste it in
   the `Azure Client Secret` field in Cypress Cloud.
1. Under **API Permissions** in Azure AD, ensure the application has access to
   **User.Read** permissions
1. Enter the domain used for your Active Directory, as well as the list of SSO
   domains you wish to allow user to authenticate with, in Cypress Cloud. This
   is used for SSO discovery from the login screen.
1. [Save Configuration](#Save-Configuration).

#### Save Configuration

1. Return to Cypress Cloud and click **Save Configuration**. Cypress Cloud will
   attempt to authenticate.

🎉 Your integration is now complete! You can invite all of the users in your
organization to sign in through your SSO provider.

#### **Notes**

- Once SSO is set up in Cypress Cloud, Users should be invited via your SSO
  provider, not Cypress Cloud.
- All SSO Users are initially added with the
  [User Role](https://on.cypress.io/users#User-roles) of Member. If a User needs
  different User Role permissions, this can be changed via Cypress Cloud by a
  current member with the role of Owner or Admin.
