## <Icon name="graduation-cap" /> What you'll learn

- What an Organization ID is and how it is useful
- How to manage Organizations
- How to apply for an Open Source (OSS) plan

:::

Organizations are used to group and manage projects. Here you can create projects, manage users, access billing and usage information, leverage third party integrations,  and apply org-level settings.

## Organization ID

An Organization's ID is a unique identifier in
[UUID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) format that can be found under the
"Organization settings" section of Cypress Cloud. This ID is used frequently by
the Support, Success, and Sales teams to reference an Organization.

To locate your Organization's ID, go to "Organization settings" then
Organization ID. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the ID for easy sharing
with Cypress teams.

## Managing Organizations

### Create Org

You can create an organization from within
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) by opening the organization
switcher and clicking **<Icon name="plus" /> Create new organization**.

<DocsImage

  alt="Create new organization"
/>

### Delete Org

You can delete organizations that you own as long as they do not have any
projects in the organization. You must first delete or transfer ownership of your projects to another organization before you can delete the organization.

## Billing & Usage

### Open Source Plan

To support the community, we provide the Open Source (OSS) plan to take
advantage of Cypress Cloud with unlimited test runs. To qualify, all Projects in
your Organization must meet the following criteria:

- Be a non-commercial entity
- Be [Public](https://on.cypress.io/projects#Change-project-access) in Cypress
  Cloud
- Your Project source code is available in a public location with an
  [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses)
- Record minimum of 500
  [tests](https://on.cypress.io/cloud-faq#What-counts-as-a-test-result) included
  with the [Free Plan](https://www.cypress.io/pricing)

### Requesting OSS plan for an Org

1. [Login](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) to the Cypress Dashboard, or
   [create an account](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) if you are a new user.

2. Go the [Organizations page](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard/organizations) to
   select the Organization you want to associate with an OSS plan. If you have no Organizations, you can create one by clicking the **+ Create New Organization** button.

1. Log into your Okta dashboard and head to the **Admin** section.
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/organizations/okta-admin-cypress-sso-setup.png"
     alt="Okta Admin"

     alt="Create Okta SAML App"
   />
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/dashboard/organizations/okta-add-application-step3-cypress-sso.png"
     alt="Create Okta SAML App"
     width-600
   />
1. Supply the following information requested in the Okta setup wizard:

- **App name:** `Cypress Cloud`
- **App logo:** [Cypress logo download](https://on.cypress.io/logo)
- **Single sign on URL:** The URL provided in Cypress Cloud
- **Audience URI:** The URI provided in Cypress Cloud
- **Attribute statements:** Add the attribute statements described in Cypress
  Cloud

1. Click **Next** then select **I'm an Okta customer** and click **Finish**.

   Cypress Cloud needs the information provided here:

- Copy the Identity Provider Single sign-on URL to Cypress Cloud.
- Download the certificate and upload that to Cypress Cloud.
  <DocsImage
    src="/img/dashboard/organizations/okta-download-certificate-for-cypress-dashboard.png"
    alt="Download Certificate"
  />

1. Navigate to the **Assignments** tab and grant your users access to Cypress
   Cloud.
1. [Save Configuration](#Save-Configuration).

##### **SAML**

Cypress Cloud can integrate with your identity provider via SAML. In addition to
the documentation below, refer to your provider's official documentation for
configuring a SAML integration.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/organizations/enterprise-SSO-SAML.png"
  alt="SAML SSO"
/>

1. Log into the admin interface for your identity provider.
1. Work through the setup wizard supplying the information requested:

- **App name:** `Cypress Cloud`
- **App logo:** [Cypress logo download](https://on.cypress.io/logo)
- **Single sign on URL:** Collect the URL provided by Cypress Cloud
- **Audience URI:** Collect the URI provided by Cypress Cloud
- Add a custom mapping of **AttributeStatements** with the following:
  - `User.Email`: User's email
  - `User.FirstName`: User's first name
  - `User.LastName`: User's last name

1. Collect the sign-on URL and certificate from your identity provider. Supply
   that to Cypress Cloud.
1. [Save Configuration](#Save-Configuration).

##### **Azure AD**

Cypress Cloud can integrate with your identity provider via Azure AD. In
addition to the documentation below, refer to the Microsoft Guides for
[configuring an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

1. Log into the Azure portal and create a new Application.
1. Work through the application setup, supplying the following information when
   requested:

- **App name:** `Cypress Cloud`
- **App logo:** [Cypress logo download](https://on.cypress.io/logo)
- **Login URL:** Collect the URL provided by Cypress Cloud

1. Collect the `Client ID` for your application provided in the Application
   overview page.
1. Go to **Certificates and Secrets** in your Azure Application and create a new
   secret that does not expire. Copy this newly-created secret and paste it in
   the `Azure Client Secret` field in Cypress Cloud.
1. Under **API Permissions** in Azure AD, ensure the application has access to
   **User.Read** permissions
1. Enter the domain used for your Active Directory, as well as the list of SSO
   domains you wish to allow user to authenticate with, in Cypress Cloud. This
   is used for SSO discovery from the login screen.
1. [Save Configuration](#Save-Configuration).

#### Save Configuration

Return to Cypress Cloud and click **Save Configuration**. Cypress Cloud will
   attempt to authenticate.

🎉 Your integration is now complete! You can invite all of the users in your
organization to sign in through your SSO provider.

#### Notes

- Once SSO is successfully set up, users will need to be invited via your SSO
  provider, as the Cypress Cloud invitation option will be disabled.
- All SSO Users are initially added with the
  [User Role](/guides/cloud/users#User-roles) of Member. If a User needs
  different User Role permissions, this can be changed via Cypress Cloud by a
  current member with the role of Owner or Admin.
- SSO users are separate accounts from Google/GitHub or email/password users. If
  there are duplicate users, duplicates can be removed by any
  [Owner or Admin](/guides/cloud/users#User-roles).
