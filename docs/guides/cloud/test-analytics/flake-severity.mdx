### Flaky Test Analytics

:::tip

<strong>
  <Icon name="star" /> Premium Cypress Cloud Feature

**Flaky Test Analytics** are available to users with a
[Team Cypress Cloud plan](https://cypress.io/pricing).

:::

The flaky tests analytics page provides a birds-eye-view on the state of flake
within your project by showing:

- Plot of the **number of flaky tests over time**.
- Overall **flakiness level** of the entire project.
- **Number of flake tests** grouped by their severity.
- Filterable **log of all flaky test** cases ordered by severity.

<strong>Flake Severity</strong>

Test flake **severity** is determined by the frequency of flake or the **flake
rate** of a given test. Flake severity level can be used to prioritize the work
needed to resolve flake issues.

Selecting any of the flaky test cases in the analytics page will reveal a test
case details panel that shows:

- Historical log of latest flaky runs
- Most common errors across the runs of the test case
- Related test case changelog
- Plot of failure rate and flaky rate over time.

All these test case level details provide deeper context around the occurrences
of flake over time to assist with debugging the root cause.

### Failure Rate vs Flake Rate

It is important to understand the distinction between failure rate and flake
rate when test retries is enabled. These two metrics are tracked over time for
each flaky test case within the flaky tests analytics page:

  alt="flake rate vs fail rate"
/>

A test case flagged as flaky could have still passed after multiple test retry
attempts. The test result status of individual test retry attempts is separate
and distinct from the final test status.

For example, a project is configured to retry failing tests up to 3 times. The
first two attempts fail, but the last and third attempt passes, resulting in a
final status of passing.

With this concept in mind, it is possible to always have zero final failure rate
while exhibiting flake as demonstrated below:
