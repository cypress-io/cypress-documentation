Cypress Cloud helps you understand various aspects of your test suite from a number of perspectives.
You can monitor and govern your application quality by looking at test case statistics, common errors,
test run duration, flake rates and much more.

- [Project Level Analytics](/guides/cloud/analytics/project-analytics): Analytics is provided
  for each project in your organization so that you can understand trends and details for an
  individual project.
- [Enterprise Reporting](/guides/cloud/analytics/enterprise-reporting): Analytics is provided
  across your organization so that you can spot patterns or anomalies between projects, track test
  usage, and ensure consistency. This level of analytics allows you to govern your testing program
  across the entire organization.
- [Data Extract API](/guides/cloud/integrations/data-extract-api): Both aggregate and raw test data can
  be extracted from Cypress Cloud in a variety of formats. Retrieve your test data to use in your
  own analytics systems or automate additional workflows that can be triggered by conditions of your
  choosing.
