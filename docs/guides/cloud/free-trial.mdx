## Structure of the Cypress Cloud free trial

Your free trial of Cypress Cloud provides a 14 day all-access pass to Cypress Cloud features.
This is the same list of Cloud features available in our Enterprise plan as described on the
[Cypress Cloud pricing page](https://www.cypress.io/pricing). 50,000 test results are included!

Experiencing the capabilities of Cypress Cloud during a trial is the quickest way to realize
that your testing life wouldn't be the same without it! After starting your trial you can select
and subscribe to a Cypress Cloud plan at any time.

However, if you determine that subscribing to a Cloud plan is
not workable at the end of 14 days, rest assured that your account will remain available to you
and revert to our _Starter_ plan. The _Starter_ plan is free, but does not have the same
set of features. The _Starter_ plan will also limit data retention to 30 days and test results
to 500 per monthly period. Details of the _Starter_ plan are available on the
[pricing page](https://www.cypress.io/pricing).

that you are not allowed to [transfer](/guides/cloud/account-management/projects#Transfer-ownership)
existing Cypress Cloud projects into your free trial organization.

## How Cypress Cloud adds value to your Cypress tests

The [Cypress App](https://www.cypress.io/app#browser_testing) is loved by software professionals
all around the world. The Cypress App is open source and provides you extensive support for
creating both end-to-end and component tests.

Are you new to Cypress and not familiar with writing Cypress tests? Check out our docs on
[Why Cypress](/guides/overview/why-cypress) and
[Key Differences](/guides/overview/key-differences) which will help you on your journey
of [getting started](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) with Cypress. You can then write
your own Cypress tests or use the built-in [Cypress Studio](/guides/references/cypress-studio)
to help generate and record your tests while you simply interact with your application!

By [starting your free trial](https://cloud.cypress.io/signup) with Cypress Cloud you will unlock
amazing new capabilities when your Cypress tests are recorded to the Cloud. Here is why you should
start using Cypress Cloud:

### Test Replay

Available in Cypress v13 and up, [Test Replay](/guides/cloud/test-replay), our
interactive debugging tool, helps you swiftly troubleshoot and debug failed or flaky test runs as they
occur in CI. This ensures your team stays focused on delivering high-quality software without the
hassle of reproducing issues.
