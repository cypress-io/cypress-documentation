The Cypress app integrates directly with Cypress Cloud to provide developers with the latest test results without having to switch tools.

<strong>Cypress Cloud integration</strong>

When you configure the open source Cypress app to record tests to
[Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/introduction), you'll see data from your latest
recorded runs directly in the Cypress app. This increased visibility into your
test history allows you to debug your tests faster and more effectively, all
within your local workflow.

The data used by these features is pulled from Cypress Cloud, so they will only
reflect test results that were
[recorded](/guides/cloud/projects#Set-up-a-project-to-record).

If you're not sure whether you're logged in, you can always check using the
profile control in the top right of the window.

### Specs

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/spec-explorer.png"
  alt="Specs"
/>

On choosing your browser in the Launchpad, you'll be presented with a list of
your specs, their names, locations, and information about your latest recorded
runs. Here you can launch specs by clicking them, create new blank or example
specs, or search specs by name (handy for large test suites).

We've made the following spec data available directly on the Specs page:

#### Last updated

This column tells you when the code of this spec was last updated, using local
file data from git or your own filesystem. It surfaces the change history of
your tests, so you can quickly find the most relevant specs as you’re browsing
your project.

This column will vary from machine to machine, as it reflects the state of the
code as stored on that computer.

#### Latest runs

This column shows the last time the spec was run, and the last four returned
statuses. Results are scoped to your current git branch if available, falling
back to the default branch if not, then finally all branches.

With this intelligence you can monitor, run, and fix tests locally within CI
workflows, and then further dig into your results by clicking through to Cypress
Cloud.

The runs data is sourced from Cypress Cloud (see [note above](#Overview)) so it
will be the same everywhere.

#### Average duration

This column indicates the time taken to run the entire spec file, averaged over
the last four runs, so that you can quickly identify and take action to improve
the performance of your long-running tests.

Again, this analysis comes from Cypress Cloud.

#### Flake annotation

:::info

<strong>What is a flaky test?</strong>

A test is considered to be [flaky](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management) when it
can pass and fail across multiple retry attempts without any code changes.

:::

Specs with flaky tests are flagged with an indicator beside the spec name. This
means you can easily discern which areas of your application might result in an
unreliable user experience.

The flake indicator will display if any tests in the given spec have been flaky
in your latest runs (limited to 4). Hovering over the indicator will show a
tooltip with the following analytics, based off the last **50** runs:

- Rate (flaky runs divided by total runs)
- Severity (flaky rate at a glance)
- Last flaky (how many runs ago)

Clicking on the flake indicator will take you to the spec’s
[Flaky Test Analytics in Cypress Cloud](https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/7s5okt/analytics/flaky-tests).

### Runs

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/recorded-runs.png"
  alt="Recorded Runs"
/>

This screen shows detailed information about the most recently recorded
[test runs](/guides/cloud/runs) across all git branches, latest first. This data
comes from Cypress Cloud (see [note above](#Overview)) so should be the same
everywhere.

The title of each run is taken from the
[git commit message](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/git-commit-message-simply-explained)
for that change, and clicking on it will take you to the corresponding run page
in Cypress Cloud.

### Debug

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/debug-page.png"
  alt="Debug"
/>

The Debug page allows you to easily debug failed CI test runs from within the
Cypress app. From this page, you can review, rerun, and debug failed CI test
runs that are recorded to Cypress Cloud (see [note above](#Overview)) - all
without leaving the Cypress app.

This feature eliminates the tedious process of switching between Cypress, your
local editor, and CI output, in order to fix failed tests. It does this by
enabling you to use the [Test Runner](#Test-Runner) to run only the tests that
failed in your last recorded test run, as well as review screenshots, videos,
and logs from your tests.

The Debug page shows the latest completed [test run](/guides/cloud/runs) that
matches the HEAD commit (the commit currently checked out in the working
directory) of your local project. Users can see and switch to relevant runs
within the Debug page. If no run is found for your current commit, then Cypress
shows the most recent run in your branch's history up until the current commit.
The first **100** failed tests are listed, with a link to Cypress Cloud to
review the full run.

To use this feature, you must ensure that git is properly configured for your
project and that you are sending git information to Cypress Cloud. Under some
environment setups (e.g. `docker`/`docker-compose`), you may have to pass git
information using
[custom environment variables](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information).
