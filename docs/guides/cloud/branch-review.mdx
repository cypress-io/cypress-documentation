Cypress Branch Review is designed to elevate your pull request (PR) review workflow. It allows you to quickly identify the impact a pull request might have on your test suite in a single view. Compare which tests are failing, flaky, pending, added, or modified between the **<u>source</u>** and **<u>base</u>** branches.

Previously, pinpointing changes in your test suite's results required a manual side-by-side comparison between your newly-introduced branch's test runs and your base branch's test runs. This sub-optimal workflow often fails to answer the fundamental questions, _what changed_ and _why?_ You might be left wondering if the same tests are flaky between branches, when new failures were introduced, or if you added sufficient test coverage to your new branch.

:::info

Cypress Branch Review is currently only available for GitHub integrations. We are working on adding support for GitLab and Bitbucket soon.

:::

## Getting Started

Your project will first need to be connected to a GitHub repository. If you haven't already, follow the steps in [Install the Cypress GitHub app](/guides/cloud/integrations/source-control/github#Install-the-Cypress-GitHub-app) to connect your project to GitHub.

To access Branch Review, navigate to the **Branches** tab in the left sidebar and select the branch you want to review. In order to see a comparison, the branch you select must have an open pull request.

## Branch Details

### View Options

_todo: add note about setup/run recording which impacts default view_

Branch Review is the default view of the **Branches** tab. You can also toggle to see a list of Runs filtered by this branch.

  alt="Displaying different views for branches"
/>

### Review Header

The header includes the Git commit message, PR selector, PR status and base and target branch indicators with the Cypress Cloud test run ID number (#).

If there are multiple pull requests open for the same branch, you can select the pull request you want to review from the dropdown to the right of the commit message.

Clicking the branch indicators will link you directly to the appropriate [test overview](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs#Overview-tab) and hovering on these elements exposes additional test meta data.

### Review Test Status

When on the review screen, you will see tabs Failures, Flaky, Pending, Added, and Modified. Each tab will show you the tests that fall into that category. You can click on a test to view the test details.

### Review Test Comparison

Navigating into the test detail view reveals a side-by-side comparison of the test results on both branches, as well as, artifacts so you can compare before vs. after your PR. This can help elevate the source of flake within tests throughout different attempts. Review the test definition panel for diff snapshots to help quickly determine changes in test code.
