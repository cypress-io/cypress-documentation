A core feature of Cypress that assists with testing dynamic web applications is
retry-ability. Like a good transmission in a car, it usually works without you
noticing it. But understanding how it works will help you write faster tests
with fewer run-time surprises.

fails, check out our guide on [Test Retries](/guides/guides/test-retries).

## Commands, Queries and Assertions

While all methods you chain off of `cy` in your Cypress tests are commands, it's
important to understand the different rules by which they operate. **Queries**
link up, retrying the entire chain together, while **non-queries** only execute
once. Assertions are a type of query that's specially displayed in the command
log. For example, there are 7 queries (2 of them assertions) and 2 non-queries
in the test below.

```javascript
it('creates an item', () => {
  // Non-query commands only execute once.
  cy.visit('/')

  // The queries .focused() and .should() link together,
  // rerunning until the currently focused element has
  // the 'new-todo' class
  cy.focused().should('have.class', 'new-todo')

  // The queries .get() and .find()
  // link together, forming the subject for
  // the non-query `.type()`.
  cy.get('.header').find('.new-todo').type('todo A{enter}')

  // Three queries chained together
  cy.get('.todoapp').find('.todo-list li').should('have.length', 1)
})
```

The [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) shows all
commands regardless of types, with passing assertions showing in green.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/retry-ability/command-assertions.png"
  alt="Cypress tests showing commands and assertions"
/>

Let's look at the last chain of commands:

```javascript
cy.get('.todoapp') // query
  .find('.todo-list li') // query
  .should('have.length', 1) // assertion
```

Because nothing is synchronous in modern web applications, Cypress can't query
all the DOM elements matching `.todo-list li` and check if there is exactly one
of them. There are many examples of why this would not work well.

- What if the application has not updated the DOM by the time these commands
  run?
- What if the application is waiting for its back end to respond before
  populating the DOM element?
- What if the application does some intensive computation before showing the
  results in the DOM?

Thus [`cy.get`](/api/commands/get) and [`cy.find()`](/api/commands/find) have to
be smarter and expect the application to potentially update. `cy.get()` queries
the application's DOM, finds the elements that match the selector, and then
passes them to `.find('.todo-list li')`. `.find()` locates a new set of
elements, and passes them to `.should()`. `.should()` then asserts on the list
of found elements (in our case, that it has a length of 1).

- ✅ If the assertion passes, then `.should()` finishes successfully.
- 🚨 If the assertion fails, then Cypress will requery the application's DOM
  again - starting from the top of the chain of linked queries. It will look for
  elements that match `.get().find()` again, and re-run the assertion. If the
  assertion still fails, Cypress continues retrying until the timeout is
  reached.

Retry-ability allows the test to complete each command as soon as the assertion
passes, without hard-coding waits. If your application takes a few milliseconds
or even seconds to render each DOM element - no big deal, the test does not have
to change at all. For example, let's introduce an artificial delay of 3 seconds
when refreshing the application's UI below in an example TodoMVC model code:

```javascript
app.TodoModel.prototype.addTodo = function (title) {
  this.todos = this.todos.concat({
    id: Utils.uuid(),
    title: title,
    completed: false,
  })

  // let's trigger the UI to render after 3 seconds
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.inform()
  }, 3000)
}
```

The test still passes! `cy.get('.todo-list')` passes immediately - the
`todo-list` exists - but `.should('have.length', 1)` shows the spinning
indicator, meaning Cypress is still .

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/retry-ability/retry-assertion.gif"
  alt="Retrying assertion"
/>

Within a few milliseconds after the DOM updates, the linked queries
`.get().find()` locate an element and `.should('have.length', 1)` passes.

## Multiple assertions

Chains of commands are always executed in order, with all previous queries
forming the subject of each following command.

For example, the following test has the [.get()](/api/commands/get),
[`.should()`](/api/commands/should) and [`.and()`](/api/commands/and) commands
chained together. All three of these are queries.

```javascript
it('creates two items', () => {
  cy.visit('/')

  cy.get('.new-todo').type('todo A{enter}')
  cy.get('.new-todo').type('todo B{enter}')

  cy.get('.todo-list li') // query
    .should('have.length', 2) // query
    .and(($li) => {
      // 2 expect() statements inside of the .and() query
      expect($li.get(0).textContent, 'first item').to.equal('todo a')
      expect($li.get(1).textContent, 'second item').to.equal('todo B')
    })
})
```

Because the first expect statement
(`expect($li.get(0).textContent, 'first item').to.equal('todo a')`) fails, the
second statement is never reached. The command fails after timing out, and the
Command Log correctly shows that `.get()` and `.should()` passed, but the "first
item" assertion failed.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/retry-ability/second-assertion-fails.gif"
  alt="Retrying multiple assertions"
/>

## Built-in assertions

Often a Cypress command has built-in assertions that will cause the command to
be retried until they pass. For example, the [`.eq()`](/api/commands/eq) query
will be retried even without any attached assertions until it finds an element
with the given index.

```javascript
cy.get('.todo-list li').should('have.length', 2).eq(3)
```

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/retry-ability/eq.gif"
  alt="Retrying built-in assertion"
/>

Only queries can be retried, but most other commands still have built-in
assertions. For example, as described in the "Assertions" section of
[.click()](/api/commands/click), the `click()` action command waits to click
until the element becomes
[actionable](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Actionability),
including re-running the query chain leading up to it in case the page updates
while we're waiting.

Cypress tries to act like a human user would using the browser.

- Can a user click on the element?
- Is the element invisible?
- Is the element behind another element?
- Does the element have the `disabled` attribute?

Action commands - such as `.click()` - automatically wait until multiple
built-in assertions like these pass, and then it will attempt to click just
once.

## Timeouts

By default each command that retries does so for up to 4 seconds - the
[`defaultCommandTimeout`](/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts) setting.

### Increase time to retry

You can change the default timeout for _all commands_. See
[Configuration: Overriding Options](/guides/references/configuration#Overriding-Options)
for examples of overriding this option.

For example, to set the default command timeout to 10 seconds via the command
line:

```shell
cypress run --config defaultCommandTimeout=10000
```

We do not recommend changing the command timeout globally. Instead, pass the
individual command's `{ timeout: ms }` option to retry for a different period of
time. For example:

```javascript
// we've modified the timeout which affects default + added assertions
cy.get('[data-testid="mobile-nav"]', { timeout: 10000 })
  .should('be.visible')
  .and('contain', 'Home')
```

Cypress will retry for up to 10 seconds to find an element with `data-testid`
attribute `mobile-nav`. It will then retry for up to 10 seconds waiting for it
to be visible; once it's visible, it will wait up to 10s for it to contain
"Home". For more examples, read the
[Timeouts](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Timeouts) section in
the "Introduction to Cypress" guide.

### Disable retry

Overriding the timeout to `0` will essentially disable retrying the query, since
it will spend 0 milliseconds retrying.

```javascript
// check synchronously that the element does not exist (no retry)
// for example just after a server-side render
cy.get('[data-testid="ssr-error"]', { timeout: 0 }).should('not.exist')
```

## Only queries are retried

Any command that isn't a query, such as `.click()`, will not "chain together" to
form the subject for later commands the way queries do. Cypress will retry any
queries _leading up to_ a command, and retry any assertions _after_ a command,
but commands themselves only execute once. After they've executed, nothing
leading up to them will retry.

Most commands are not retried because they could potentially change the state of
the application under test. For example, Cypress will not retry the
[.click()](/api/commands/click) action command, because it could change
something in the application. After the click occurs, Cypress will also not
re-run any queries before `.click()`.

### Actions should be at the end of chains, not the middle

The following test might have problems if:

- Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously
- Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element

#### <Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red" /> Incorrectly chaining commands

```javascript
cy.get('.new-todo')
  .type('todo A{enter}') // action
  .type('todo B{enter}') // action after another action - bad
  .should('have.class', 'active') // assertion after an action - bad
```

#### <Icon name="check-circle" color="green" /> Correctly ending chains after an action

To avoid these issues entirely, it is better to split up the above chain of
commands.

```javascript
cy.get('.new-todo').type('todo A{enter}')
cy.get('.new-todo').type('todo B{enter}')
cy.get('.new-todo').should('have.class', 'active')
```

Writing your tests in this way will help you avoid issues where the page
rerenders in the middle of your test and Cypress loses track of which elements
it's supposed to be operating or asserting on. Aliases -
[`cy.as()`](/api/commands/as) - can help make this pattern less intrusive.

```javascript
cy.get('.new-todo').as('new')

cy.get('@new').type('todo A{enter}')
cy.get('@new').type('todo B{enter}')
cy.get('@new').should('have.class', 'active')
```

:::caution

Very rarely you may want to retry a command like `.click()`. We describe one
case like that where the event listeners are attached to a modal popup only
after a delay, thus causing default events fired during `.click()` to not
register. In this special case you may want to "keep clicking" until the event
registers, and the dialog disappears. Read about it in the
[When Can the Test Click?](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/01/22/when-can-the-test-click/)
blog post.

Because of the default assertions built into every command, and action commands
in particular, you should rarely need this pattern.

:::

As another example, when confirming that the button component invokes the
`click` prop testing with the
[cypress/react](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/master/npm/react)
mounting library, the following test might or might not work:

#### <Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red" /> Incorrectly checking if the stub was called

```js
const Clicker = ({ click }) => (
  <div>
    <button onClick={click}>Click me</button>
  </div>
)

it('calls the click prop twice', () => {
  const onClick = cy.stub()
  cy.mount(<Clicker click={onClick} />)
  cy.get('button')
    .click()
    .click()
    .then(() => {
      // works in this case, but not recommended
      // because .click() and .then() do not retry
      expect(onClick).to.be.calledTwice
    })
})
```

The above example will fail if the component calls the `click` prop after a
delay.

```js
const Clicker = ({ click }) => (
  <div>
    <button onClick={() => setTimeout(click, 500)}>Click me</button>
  </div>
)
```

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/retry-ability/delay-click.png"
  alt="Expect fails the test without waiting for the delayed stub"
/>

The test finishes before the component calls the `click` prop twice, and without
retrying the assertion `expect(onClick).to.be.calledTwice`.

It could also fail if React or another javascript library decided to rerender
the DOM between clicks.

#### <Icon name="check-circle" color="green" /> Correctly waiting for the stub to be called

We recommend aliasing the stub using the [`.as`](/api/commands/as) command and
using `cy.get('@alias')` to run assertions.

```js
it('calls the click prop', () => {
  const onClick = cy.stub().as('clicker')

  cy.mount(<Clicker click={onClick} />)
  // Good practice 💡: Don't chain anything off of commands
  cy.get('button').click()
  cy.get('button').click()

  // Good practice 💡: Reference the stub with an alias
  cy.get('@clicker').should('have.been.calledTwice')
})
```

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/retry-ability/click-twice.gif"
  alt="Retrying the assertions using a stub alias"
/>

### Use `.should()` with a callback

If you are using commands, but need to retry the entire chain, consider
rewriting the commands into a
[.should(callbackFn)](/api/commands/should#Function).

Below is an example where the number value is set after a delay:

```html
<div class="random-number-example">
  Random number: <span id="random-number">🎁</span>
</div>
<script>
  const el = document.getElementById('random-number')
  setTimeout(() => {
    el.innerText = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1)
  }, 1500)
</script>
```

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/retry-ability/random-number.gif"
  alt="Random number"
/>

### <Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red" /> Incorrectly waiting for values

You may want to write a test like below, to test that the number is between 1
and 10, although **this will not work as intended**. The test yields the
following values, noted in the comments, before failing.

```javascript
// WRONG: this test will not work as intended
cy.get('[data-testid="random-number"]') // <div>🎁</div>
  .invoke('text') // "🎁"
  .then(parseFloat) // NaN
  .should('be.gte', 1) // fails
  .and('be.lte', 10) // never evaluates
```

Unfortunately, the [.then()](/api/commands/then) command breaks the chain of
queries - nothing before it (such as fetching the text of the element) re-runs.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/retry-ability/random-number-first-attempt.png"
  alt="First attempt at writing the test"
/>

#### <Icon name="check-circle" color="green" /> Correctly waiting for values

We need to retry getting the element, invoking the `text()` method, calling the
`parseFloat` function and running the `gte` and `lte` assertions. We can achieve
this using the `.should(callbackFn)`.

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="random-number"]').should(($div) => {
  // all the code inside here will retry
  // until it passes or times out
  const n = parseFloat($div.text())

  expect(n).to.be.gte(1).and.be.lte(10)
})
```

The above test retries getting the element and invoking the text of the element
to get the number. When the number is finally set in the application, then the
`gte` and `lte` assertions pass and the test passes.
