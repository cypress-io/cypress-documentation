## Overview

The Cypress desktop app has powerful features for creating, configuring,
browsing, and most importantly running your tests. We'll touch on a few of the
different functions before moving on to the Test Runner, the heart of the
Cypress testing experience.

:::info

<strong>Cypress Cloud integration</strong>

When you configure the open source Cypress app to record tests to
[Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/introduction), you'll see data from your latest
recorded runs directly in the Cypress app. This increased visibility into your
test history allows you to debug your tests faster and more effectively, all
within your local workflow.

The data used by these features is pulled from Cypress Cloud, so they will only
reflect test results that were
[recorded](/guides/cloud/getting-started#Set-up-a-project-to-record).

If you're not sure whether you're logged in, you can always check using the
profile control in the top right of the window.

### Launchpad

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/the-launchpad.png"
  alt="The Launchpad"
/>

The Launchpad is your portal to Cypress, helping with onboarding, choosing a
testing type and launching a browser.

Once you get comfortable with Cypress you might find you don't need the
Launchpad any more. In this case
[you can run `cypress open` with the `--browser` and `--component` or `--e2e` options](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open)
to go straight to the Specs page.

### Specs

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/spec-explorer.png"
  alt="Specs"
/>

On choosing your browser in the Launchpad, you'll be presented with a list of
your specs, their names, locations, and information about your latest recorded
runs. Here you can launch specs by clicking them, create new blank or example
specs, or search specs by name (handy for large test suites).

We've made the following spec data available directly on the Specs page:

#### Last updated

This column tells you when the code of this spec was last updated, using local
file data from git or your own filesystem. It surfaces the change history of
your tests, so you can quickly find the most relevant specs as you’re browsing
your project.

This column will vary from machine to machine, as it reflects the state of the
code as stored on that computer.

#### Latest runs

This column shows the last time the spec was run, and the last four returned
statuses. Results are scoped to your current git branch if available, falling
back to the default branch if not, then finally all branches.

With this intelligence you can monitor, run, and fix tests locally within CI
workflows, and then further dig into your results by clicking through to Cypress
Cloud.

The runs data is sourced from Cypress Cloud (see [note above](#Overview)) so it
will be the same everywhere.

#### Average duration

This column indicates the time taken to run the entire spec file, averaged over
the last four runs, so that you can quickly identify and take action to improve
the performance of your long-running tests.

Again, this analysis comes from Cypress Cloud.

#### Flake annotation

:::info

<strong>What is a flaky test?</strong>

A test is considered to be [flaky](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management) when it
can pass and fail across multiple retry attempts without any code changes.

:::

Specs with flaky tests are flagged with an indicator beside the spec name. This
means you can easily discern which areas of your application might result in an
unreliable user experience.

The flake indicator will display if any tests in the given spec have been flaky
in your latest runs (limited to 4). Hovering over the indicator will show a
tooltip with the following analytics, based off the last **50** runs:

- Rate (flaky runs divided by total runs)
- Severity (flaky rate at a glance)
- Last flaky (how many runs ago)

Clicking on the flake indicator will take you to the spec’s
[Flaky Test Analytics in Cypress Cloud](https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/7s5okt/analytics/flaky-tests).

#### Running Specs

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/spec-page.png"
  alt="Specs"
/>

To run a spec, simply click the row with the spec you would like to run. You
will be taken to the [Test Runner](#Test-Runner) and the spec will execute. You
can narrow down the list of specs by typing into the search bar (1).

It is also possible to run multiple specs sequentially using the
[`experimentalRunAllSpecs`](/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing)
(2).

:::caution

<strong>Experimental Run All Specs</strong>

`experimentalRunAllSpecs` currently works with End to End Testing.

Running multiple specs sequentially is currently an
[experimental feature](/guides/references/configuration#Experiments) and it may
change in the future. There are some known limitations outlined in this
[GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21628).

Running a large number of specs sequentially can consume more resources.

:::

### Runs

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/recorded-runs.jpg"
  alt="Recorded Runs"
/>

This screen shows detailed information about the most recently recorded
[test runs](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs#Latest-Runs) to Cypress Cloud, showing
the latest first.

Cypress uses Git to show runs for your branch. Ensure that version control is
properly configured and that you are sending Git information to Cypress Cloud.
If no runs are found for your current branch, all runs for your project are
shown as a fallback.

The title of each run is taken from the
[git commit message](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/git-commit-message-simply-explained)
for that change, and clicking on it will take you to the corresponding run page
in Cypress Cloud.

### Debug

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/debug-page.png"
  alt="Debug"
/>

The Debug page allows you to easily debug failed CI test runs from within the
Cypress app. From this page, you can review, rerun, and debug failed CI test
runs that are recorded to Cypress Cloud (see [note above](#Overview)) - all
without leaving the Cypress app.

This feature eliminates the tedious process of switching between Cypress, your
local editor, and CI output, in order to fix failed tests. It does this by
enabling you to use the [Test Runner](#Test-Runner) to run only the tests that
failed in your last recorded test run, as well as review the
[Test Replay](/guides/cloud/test-replay) and other artifacts like screenshots,
videos, and logs from your tests.

The Debug page shows the latest completed
[test run](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs#Latest-Runs) that matches the `HEAD` commit
(the commit currently checked out in the working directory) of your local
project. Users can see and switch to relevant runs within the Debug page. If no
run is found for your current commit, then Cypress shows the most recent run in
your branch's history up until the current commit. The first **100** failed
tests are listed, with a link to Cypress Cloud to review the full run.

To use this feature, you must ensure that git is properly configured for your
project and that you are sending git information to Cypress Cloud. Under some
environment setups (e.g. `docker`/`docker-compose`), you may have to pass git
information using
[custom environment variables](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information).

### Cloud Run Notifications

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/runs/app-notification.jpg"
  alt="App notification on macOS"
/>

You can receive notifications in the Cypress app for recorded runs directly from
Cypress Cloud. Learn more about [Cloud Run Notifications](/guides/cloud/recorded-runs#Notifications).

## Test Runner

At the core of the app is the Test Runner itself. Cypress runs tests
interactively, allowing you to see commands as they execute while also viewing
the Application or Component Under Test, and exploring its DOM.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/test-runner.png"
  alt="The Test Runner"
/>

## Command Log

The left-hand side of the Test Runner is a visual representation of your test
suite. Each test block is properly nested and each test, when clicked, displays
every Cypress command executed within the test's block as well as any commands
executed in relevant `before`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, and `after` hooks.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/command-log.png"
  alt="Cypress app"
  width-600
/>

### Open files in your IDE

There are some places in the Command Log that display a link to the relevant
file where the code is located. Clicking on this link will open the file in your
[preferred file opener](/guides/tooling/IDE-integration#File-Opener-Preference).

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/open-file-in-IDE.gif"
  alt="Open file in your IDE"
/>

### Time traveling

Each command, when hovered over, restores the Application or Component Under
Test (right-hand side) to the state it was in when that command executed. This
allows you to **time travel** back to previous states when testing.

:::tip

By default, Cypress keeps **50** tests worth of snapshots and command data for
time traveling. If you are seeing extremely high memory consumption in your
browser, you may want to lower the `numTestsKeptInMemory` in your
[Cypress configuration](/guides/references/configuration#Global).

:::

In the following example, hovering over the [`contains`](/api/commands/contains)
command in the Command Log changes the state of the
[AUT](#Application-Under-Test) preview:

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/first-test-hover-contains.png"
  alt="Hovering over the contains tab highlights the dom element in the App in the Cypress app"
/>

Cypress automatically travels back in time to a snapshot of when a hovered-over
command resolved. Additionally, since [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains)
finds DOM elements on the page, Cypress also highlights the element and scrolls
it into view (to the top of the page).

Also note that as we hover over the [`contains`](/api/commands/contains)
command, Cypress reverts back to the URL that was present when the snapshot was
taken.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/first-test-url-revert.png"
  alt="The url address bar shows https://example.cypress.io/"
/>

### Pinning snapshots

Each command, when clicked on, displays extra information in the dev tools
console. Clicking also **pins** the Application or Component Under Test
(right-hand side) to its previous state, or **snapshot**, when the command
executed.

In the following example, clicking on the `CLICK` command highlights it in
purple, and does three other things worth noting:

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/first-test-click-revert.png"
  alt="A click on the click command in the Command Log with Cypress app labeled as 1, 2, 3"
/>

#### 1. Pinned snapshots

We have now **pinned** this snapshot. Hovering over other commands will not
revert to them. This gives us a chance to manually inspect the DOM of our
application under test at the time the snapshot was taken.

#### 2. Event hitbox

Since [`.click()`](/api/commands/click) is an action command, that means we also
see a red hitbox at the coordinates the event took place.

#### 3. Snapshot menu panel

There is also a new menu panel. Some commands (like action commands) will take
multiple snapshots: **before** and **after**. We can now cycle through these.

The **before** snapshot is taken prior to the click event firing. The **after**
snapshot is taken immediately after the click event. Although this click event
caused our browser to load a new page, it's not an instantaneous transition.
Depending on how fast your page loaded, you may still see the same page, or a
blank screen as the page is unloading and in transition.

When a command causes an immediate visual change in our application, cycling
between before and after will update our snapshot. We can see this in action by
clicking the `TYPE` command in the Command Log. Now, clicking **before** will
show us the input in a default state, showing the placeholder text. Click
**after** will show us what the input looks like when the `TYPE` command has
completed.

### Page events

In addition to showing all the commands that were called, the command log also
shows important events from your application or component when they occur.
Notice these look different (they are gray and without a number).

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/first-test-page-load.png"
  alt="Command log shows 'Page load --page loaded--' and 'New url https://example.cypress.io/'"
/>

**Cypress logs out page events for:**

- Network XHR Requests
- URL hash changes
- Page Loads
- Form Submissions

### Instrument panel

For certain commands like [`cy.intercept()`](/api/commands/intercept),
[`cy.stub()`](/api/commands/stub), and [`cy.spy()`](/api/commands/spy), an extra
instrument panel is displayed above the test to give more information about the
state of your tests.

#### Routes

<!-- Code to reproduce screenshot:
it('intercept command log', () => {
    cy.intercept('GET', '/comments/1').as('getComment')
    .intercept('POST', '/comments').as('postComment')
    .intercept('PUT', /comments\/\d+/, 'res').as('putComment')

    cy.then(() => {
        Cypress.$.get('/comments/1')
    })
})
-->

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/instrument-panel-routes.png"
  alt="Routes Instrument Panel"
/>

#### Stubs

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/instrument-panel-stubs.png"
  alt="Stubs Instrument Panel"

## Preview pane

The right-hand side of the Test Runner is where the Application or Component
Under Test is rendered.

### Application Under Test <E2EOnlyBadge />

In
[E2E Testing](/guides/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-E2E-Testing),
the right-hand side of the Test Runner is used to display the Application Under
Test (AUT): the application that was navigated to using a
[`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) or any subsequent routing calls made from
the visited application.

In the example below, we wrote the following code in our test file:

```javascript
cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')

cy.title().should('include', 'Kitchen Sink')
```

In the corresponding application preview below, you can see
`https://example.cypress.io` is being displayed in the right-hand side. Not only
is the application visible, but it is fully interactive. You can open your
developer tools to inspect elements as you would in your normal application. The
DOM is completely available for debugging.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/application-under-test.png"
  alt="Application Under Test"
/>

The AUT also displays in the size and orientation specified in your tests. You
can change the size or orientation with the
[`cy.viewport()`](/api/commands/viewport) command or in your
[Cypress configuration](/guides/references/configuration#Viewport). If the AUT
does not fit within the current browser window, it is scaled appropriately to
fit within the window.

The current size and scale of the AUT is displayed in the top right corner of
the window.

The image below shows that our application is displaying at `1000px` width,
`660px` height and scaled to `100%`.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/viewport-scaling.png"
  alt="Viewport Scaling"
/>

:::info

The right-hand side may also be used to display syntax errors in your spec file
that prevent the tests from running.

:::

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/aut-error-e2e.png"
  alt="Errors"
/>

:::caution

Internally, the AUT renders within an iframe. This can sometimes cause
unexpected behaviors
[explained here.](/api/commands/window#Cypress-uses-2-different-windows)

:::

### Component Under Test <ComponentOnlyBadge />

In
[Component testing](/guides/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-Component-Testing),
the right-hand side of the Test Runner is used to display the Component Under
Test (CUT): the component that was mounted using the
[`cy.mount()`](/api/commands/mount) command.

In the following example, we have the following test in our spec file:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='React'>

```js
it('should have password input of type password', () => {
  mount(<LoginForm />)
  cy.contains('Password').find('input').should('have.attr', 'type', 'password')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='Vue'>

```js
it('should have password input of type password', () => {
  mount(LoginForm)
  cy.contains('Password').find('input').should('have.attr', 'type', 'password')
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the corresponding Component Preview below, you can see the `LoginForm`
component is being displayed in the right-hand side. Not only is the component
visible, but it is fully interactable. You can open your developer tools to
inspect elements as you would in your normal application. The DOM is completely
available for debugging.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/component-under-test.png"
  alt="Cypress app showing mounted component and password assertion"
/>

The CUT also displays in the size and orientation specified in your tests. You
can change the size or orientation with the
[`cy.viewport()`](/api/commands/viewport) command or in your
[Cypress configuration](/guides/references/configuration#Viewport). If the CUT
does not fit within the current browser window, it is scaled appropriately to
fit within the window.

The current size and scale of the CUT is displayed in the top right corner of
the window.

The image below shows that our application is displaying at `500px` width,
`500px` height and scaled to `100%`.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/viewport-scaling-ct.png"
  alt="Cypress app showing mounted component test viewport scale"
/>

:::info

The right-hand side may also be used to display syntax errors in your spec file
that prevent the tests from running.

:::

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/aut-error-ct.png"
  alt="Cypress app showing error as application under test"
/>

:::caution

Internally, the AUT renders within an iframe. This can sometimes cause
unexpected behaviors
[explained here.](/api/commands/window#Cypress-uses-2-different-windows)

:::

## Selector Playground

The Selector Playground is an interactive feature that helps you:

- Determine a unique selector for an element.
- See what elements match a given selector.
- See what element matches a string of text.

<DocsVideo
  src="/img/snippets/selector-playground.mp4"
  title="Selector Playground demo"
/>

:::info

Needing a low code approach to create tests? Use
[Cypress Studio](/guides/references/cypress-studio) to record your browser
interactions.

:::

### Uniqueness

Cypress will automatically calculate a **unique selector** to use targeted
element by running through a series of selector strategies.

<DefaultSelectorPriority />

:::tip

<strong>This is configurable</strong>

Cypress allows you to control how a selector is determined.

Use the [Cypress.SelectorPlayground](/api/cypress-api/selector-playground-api)
API to control the selectors you want returned.

:::

### Best practices

You may find yourself struggling to write good selectors because:

- Your application or component uses dynamic ID's and class names
- Your tests break whenever there are CSS or content changes

To help with these common challenges, the Selector Playground automatically
prefers certain `data-*` attributes when determining a unique selector.

Please read our
[Best Practices guide](/guides/references/best-practices#Selecting-Elements) on
helping you target elements and prevent tests from breaking on CSS or JS
changes.

### Finding selectors

To open the Selector Playground, click the <Icon name="crosshairs" /> button
next to the URL at the top of the Test Runner. Hover over elements in your app
to preview a unique selector for that element in the tooltip.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/open-selector-playground.gif"
  alt="Opening selector playground and hovering over elements"
/>

Click on the element and its selector will appear at the top. From there, you
can copy it to your clipboard ( <Icon name="copy" /> ) or print it to the
console ( <Icon name="terminal" /> ).

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/copy-selector-in-selector-playground.gif"
  alt="Clicking an element, copying its selector to clipboard, printing it to the console"
/>

### Running experiments

The box at the top that displays the selector is also a text input.

#### Editing a selector

When you edit the selector, it will show you how many elements match and
highlight those elements in your app.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/typing-a-selector-to-find-in-playground.gif"
  alt="Type a selector to see what elements it matches"
/>

#### Switching to contains

You can also experiment with what [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains)
would yield given a string of text. Click on `cy.get` and switch to
`cy.contains`.

Type in text to see which element it matches. Note that
[`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) only yields the first element that
matches the text, even if multiple elements on the page contain the text.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/cy-contains-in-selector-playground.gif"
  alt="Experiment with cy.contains"
/>

#### Disabling highlights

If you would like to interact with your app while the Selector Playground is
open, the element highlighting might get in the way. Toggling the highlighting
off will allow you to interact with your app more easily.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/turn-off-highlight-in-selector-playground.gif"
  alt="Turn off highlighting"
/>

## Keyboard shortcuts

There are keyboard shortcuts to quickly perform common actions from within
Cypress.

| Key | Action                        |
| --- | ----------------------------- |
| `r` | Rerun tests                   |
| `s` | Stop tests                    |
| `f` | Bring focus to 'specs' window |

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/keyboard-shortcuts.png"
  alt="Tooltips show keyboard shortcuts"
/>

## Debugging

In addition to the features already mentioned, Cypress comes with a host of
debugging tools to help you understand a test. You can:

- See detailed information about [errors](#Errors) that occur.
- Receive additional [console output](#Console-output) about each command.
- [Pause commands](#Special-commands) and step through them iteratively.
  {/* - Visualize when hidden or multiple elements are found. */}

### Errors

<AnatomyOfAnError />

### Console output

Besides commands being interactive, they also output additional debugging
information to your console.

Open up your Dev Tools and click on the `GET` for the `.action-email` class
selector.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/first-test-console-output.png"
  alt="Cypress app with get command pinned and console log open showing the yielded element"
/>

**We can see Cypress output additional information in the console:**

- Command (that was issued)
- Yielded (what was returned by this command)
- Elements (the number of elements found)
- Selector (the argument we used)

We can even expand what was returned and inspect each individual element or even
right click and inspect them in the Elements panel!

### Special commands

In addition to having a helpful UI, there are also special commands dedicated to
the task of debugging, for example:

- [cy.pause()](/api/commands/pause)
- [cy.debug()](/api/commands/debug)

In the following example, we've added a [cy.pause()](/api/commands/pause)
command to this test:

```js
describe('My First Test', () => {
  it('clicking "type" shows the right headings', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')

    cy.pause()

    cy.contains('type').click()

    // Should be on a new URL which includes '/commands/actions'
    cy.url().should('include', '/commands/actions')

    // Get an input, type into it and verify that the value has been updated
    cy.get('[data-testid="action-email"]')
      .type('fake@email.com')
      .should('have.value', 'fake@email.com')
  })
})
```

Now, when the test runs, Cypress provides us a UI (similar to debugger) to step
forward through each command in the test.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/first-test-paused.png"
  alt="Cypress app shows label saying 'Paused' with Command Log showing 'Pause'"
/>

In action:
