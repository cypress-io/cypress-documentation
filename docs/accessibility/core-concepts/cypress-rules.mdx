# Cypress rules

In addition to the default ruleset of the Axe-Core® library, we also develop custom rules that take advantage of the addition layer of information available in a test automation context.

The first custom rule that we have implemented is called "Interactive elements must be semantically correct." At launch, it is a non-blocking **manual-review** rule that will either pass or return an inconclusive state.

## Interactive elements must be semantically correct

This custom rule is intended to surface the kinds of elements that Axe-Core® traditionally does not evaluate as interactive, even though users may threat them that way.

This works based on the interactions that take place during testing.
