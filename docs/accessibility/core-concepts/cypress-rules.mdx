# Cypress rules

In addition to running the default ruleset of the Axe-Core® library, we also create custom rules that take advantage of the addition layer of information available in a test automation context. These rules are identified by a "Cypress Rule" badge, to distinguish them from the main Axe-Core® rule set.

The first custom rule that we have implemented is called "Interactive elements must be semantically correct." At launch, it is a non-blocking **manual-review** rule that will either pass or return an inconclusive state.

## Interactive elements must be semantically correct

**Rule ID**: `semantic-html-warning`

This custom rule is intended to surface potential usability problems with the kinds of elements that Axe-Core® traditionally does not evaluate as interactive, such as div, span, SVG, and image elements. 

This works based on the interactions that take place during testing. Often an inaccessible custom component will have Cypress tests that perform interactions the way a user does, and that allows us to detect a mismatch between the underlying purpose of the element in code, and the usage of the element in the context of a test.

### How to pass this rule

You should look at the purpose and nature of the specific elements flagged by this rule and decide what interactive element is appropriate for the interactions that a user can do and the effects of the interaction. 

For example, if the element that gets flagged is a span that has been styled to look like a button and submits a form, the correct solution would be standard html button element. But if the same element was styled with underlined text, and when clicked it resets the URL to navigate to a new page, the correct element is a link.

The goal of this rule is not to propose the correct element for your scenarios, but to surface the elements that need attention so that you can make this decision. After that, with appropriate semantics in place, the elements will then be able to be correctly parsed and analyzed by the standard Axe-Core® checks.

**Tip**: We recommend following the [first rule of ARIA use](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#firstrule) and implementing interactive controls with standard semantic HTML where possible, relying on ARIA `role` attributes only when no suitable HTML element is available.

### Why this matters

In the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), interactive elements are required to met a wide range of Success Criteria (SCs) in order to follow the POUR principles, which stands for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

Interactive elements that are not semantically correct often don't appear in automated scans, but do appear in manual testing, because they are usually not operable with a keyboard or correctly understandable when described by a screen reader.

Custom components implemented this way have a direct impact on the independence of your disabled users.

### Related WCAG Success Criteria

An incorrectly implemented interactive element may be failing multiple Success Criteria from WCAG, for example:

- [SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships)
- [SC 2.1.1 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard)
- [SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value)

### Status

This rule is available in all Cypress Accessibility projects, though it is not turned on by default at launch. Reach out to Cypress if you would like to have this rule activated for you early.

### Possible outcomes

For each run, this rule can be in one of four states. Most importantly, it will never fail, which means it will not affect your accessibility score.


| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pass** | No interactive elements with semantic issues were detected during the test run. |
| **Inconclusive** | Interactive elements with potential semantic issues were detected. You should review each element and determine the correct solution. |
| **Not Applicable** | The test run did not interact with any elements. |
| **Ignored by configuration** | The rule was not executed during this test run because it was intentionally turned off. |


### False positives

We expect a certain number of false positives to be detected during the initial rollout. If you see these, please use the "Submit Feedback" button in the product to let us know. Our goal is to follow the general Axe-Core® philosophy that minimizes false positives.
