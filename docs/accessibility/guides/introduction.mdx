## Maximize the Impact of Cypress Accessibility

These guides will help you leverage Cypress Accessibility to improve and maintain the accessibility of the websites and applications you test with Cypress. Learn how to configure the tool for your specific goals and collaborate with your Cypress representative to maximize its value based on the goals you have for each application you are testing.

Every project will be in a different state when you start to use Cypress Accessibility. You might find you have thousands of issues on hundreds of different pages and components, or you might have just a few issues detected in an already-accessible experience.

**For projects with many accessibility issues, we'll show you how to:**

- Drive remediation and measurable improvement.
- Establish accessibility standards incrementally.
- Celebrate quick wins to build momentum.
- Compare runs to understand what's working and see only new issues.

**For well-maintained projects, we'll focus on:**

- Efficiently maintaining high standards.
- Preventing regressions with resilient workflows.

Passing automated checks is not the end goalâ€”creating a truly usable, accessible, and equal experience to all your users is. These guides will also discuss limitations related to static automatic checks and how to write explicit test coverage to prevent regressions and increase confidence.
