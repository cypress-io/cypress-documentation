## Making the most of Cypress Accessibility

In these guides, we'll describe how to leverage Cypress Accessibility to improve and maintain the accessibility of the websites and applications you test with Cypress. We'll also discuss how to work with your Cypress point-of-contact to set the product up to provide the most value to you based on the goals you have for each specific app you are testing.

Every project will be in a different state when you start to use Cypress Accessibility. You might find you have thousands of issues on hundreds of different pages and components, or you might have just a few issues detected in an already-accessible experience.

For projects that have a high volume of issues, we'll describe how to use Cypress Accessibility to drive the process of remediation and improvement, get some measurable wins on the board for your team, and support the gradual introduction of accessibility standards.

For projects with few or no issues currently, weâ€™ll lay out how Cypress supports a resilient, efficient, and timely approach to maintain your standards and avoid surprises over the long term.

The end goal of this process is not to simply pass all your automated accessibility checks, but to deliver a truly usable, accessible, and equal experience to all your users. So we'll also discuss limitations related to static automatic checks and how to write explicit test coverage to prevent regressions and increase confidence.
