# Block pull requests and set policies

Cypress Accessibility reports are generated server-side in Cypress Cloud, based on test artifacts uploaded during execution. This ensures there is no performance impact on your Cypress test runs.

## Using the Results API

The [Cypress Accessibility Results API](/accessibility/results-api) allows you to access accessibility results post-test run, enabling workflows like blocking pull requests or triggering alerts based on specific accessibility criteria. This involves adding a dedicated accessibility verification step to your CI pipeline. With a Cypress helper function, you can automatically fetch the report for the relevant test run within the CI build context. Below is an example of how to block a pull request in GitHub Actions if accessibility violations occur:

  alt="On the left hand side, a list of Github Actions jobs is presented related to building, testing and deploying a website. Everything has a green checkmark except the `verify-accessibility-results` job, and the 'test' job that is its parents. On the right hand side we see the terminal output for that job which warns us that the 'button-name' rule has been broken, and that it was previously passing."

## Implementing a status check

The Results API offers full flexibility to analyze results and take tailored actions. It can also integrate with status checks on pull requests. Below is an example of a passing accessibility verification step:

  alt="An example list of GitHub Status Checks including a passing `verify-accessibility-results` check"
  noBorder={true}
/>

## Defining policies in the verification step

The [Results API Documentation](/accessibility/results-api) provides detailed guidance on the API's capabilities. Here's a simplified example demonstrating how to enforce a "no new failing accessibility rules" policy:

```js
const { getAccessibilityResults } = require('@cypress/extract-cloud-results')

// List of known failing rules
const rulesWithExistingViolations = [
  'button-name',
  // Add more rules as needed
]

// Fetch accessibility results
getAccessibilityResults().then((results) => {
  // Identify new rule violations
  const newRuleViolations = results.rules.filter((rule) => {
    return !rulesWithExistingViolations.includes(rule.name)
  })

  if (newRuleViolations.length > 0) {
    // Trigger appropriate action if new violations are detected
    throw new Error(
      `${newRuleViolations.length} new rule violations detected. These must be resolved.`
    )
  }
})
```

By examining the results and customizing your response, you gain maximum control over how to handle accessibility violations. Leverage CI environment context, such as tags, to fine-tune responses to specific accessibility outcomes.
