# Cypress Accessibility

<AccessibilityAddon />

Cypress Accessibility provides organized, visual, and actionable accessibility reports, based completely on the tests you record to Cypress Cloud, and powered by Axe Core® by Deque Systems.

To learn about the general topic of accessibility testing using the Cypress App, see [our guide on this topic](/app/guides/accessibility-testing).

## How it works

Cypress Cloud generates an accessibility report for each unique state reached during your tests on a given Cypress run. This includes pages visited in end-to-end tests, as well as individual components rendered in component tests, and any states or pages that were encountered as a result of interactions performed during test execution.

These individual accessibility "snapshots" are grouped into page- or component-level reports (called "Views"), and also form the bases of a unified report covering the entire run. This gives you multiple ways to examine your report - by focusing on the most important parts of your application, or by

Reports are generated using the industry-standard open source [Axe Core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core)® library created by Deque Systems, with a default configuration focused on the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).&#x20;

## Understanding what is tested

Axe Core® checks for accessibility violations in your website's user interface, based on common accessibility standards. A violation detected by Axe usually indicates that some users with disabilities would have a problem using or perceiving a feature. An example of a violation would be an image without alternative text provided in the markup, which means the content is not perceivable to visually-impaired users.

Axe reaches a high standard for automated testing, but cannot test every possible aspect of compliance, especially for heavily custom interfaces or aspects requiring human judgment. Please note that a 100% axe score does not mean all possible accessibility errors have been ruled out. [Axe typically detects up to 57% of the issues that would appear in a manual accessibility audit.](https://www.deque.com/blog/automated-testing-study-identifies-57-percent-of-digital-accessibility-issues/)

## Highlights

* All steps of all user flows tested in Cypress are captured automatically
* Server-side execution means no disruption to existing test code or practices, and no performance impact
* Reports are generated at the page or component level, as well as a combined report showing the outcome of all accessibility rules checked in the run
* Debuggable full-page DOM snapshots with highlights are provided for every violation
* Iframes and Shadow DOM are supported out-of-the-box
* The Results API allows you to own how your CI pipeline reacts to the accessibility results of the run to implement a policy
* "Ignored" elements are isolated and don't affect your score, but can still be reviewed
