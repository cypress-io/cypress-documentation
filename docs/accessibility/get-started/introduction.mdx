# Automated accessibility checks on every test

Cypress Accessibility adds detailed accessibility checks and workflows in Cypress Cloud, with zero impact on test execution.

- Instantly visualize, triage, and fix accessibility violations without any additional code or configuration.
- Dive deep into each violation with live, fully-rendered DOM snapshots of your application as it appeared during your tests.
- Filter out the noise to explore only newly-introduced issues related to specific commits.
- Track your team's progress over time with historical scores to monitor improvements and identify regressions.

## Get Started

You don't need to make any changes to your code or your test setup. If you record test runs to the Cypress Cloud with Test Replay, you're ready to start using Cypress Accessibility.
You'll start your [free trial](https://www.cypress.io/accessibility?utm_medium=intro-cta&utm_source=docs.cypress.io&utm_content=Request%20trial) with personalized support
from our sales team and your existing test data to instantly see full accessibility reports for all your Cypress projects.
From there, you can integrate with CI to set your own standards for handling the results.

## What to expect

Cypress Accessibility delivers detailed, actionable accessibility reports directly from your tests, powered by the industry-leading Axe Core® library by Deque Systems. These reports require no extra setup and are automatically generated for every unique state reached during your Cypress tests, whether in end-to-end or component testing.

- **No setup**: Cypress Accessibility utilizes the same capture protocol as [Test Replay](/cloud/features/test-replay) (requires Cypress v13+), so no additional code or configuration is needed.
- **No test slowdown or flakiness**: Server-side execution ensures no impact on test performance or existing code.
- **Comprehensive reporting**: During test execution, unique states—defined by distinct DOM structures—are recorded for end-to-end views and components.
- **DOM snapshots**: Each detected violation is accompanied by a [full-page, inspectable DOM snapshot](/accessibility/core-concepts/inspecting-violation-details), highlighting the exact location and context of the violation.
- **Report generation**: [Detailed reports](/accessibility/core-concepts/run-level-reports) are generated, offering sortable and filterable views by page, component, or the entire test run. Rule-based summaries for an aggregated view of accessibility outcomes for the entire run are also available.
- **Run comparison**: Compare the results from two runs and see only the new issues. Know before you merge if a code change is going to cause new accessibility problems.
- **Selective element handling**: Elements marked as "ignored" in tests are excluded from scoring but remain visible for manual review, ensuring flexibility via [configuration](/accessibility/configuration/overview).
- **Flexible pipeline integration**: The [Results API](/accessibility/results-api) allows you to programmatically control your CI pipeline's behavior based on accessibility outcomes, enabling enforcement of accessibility policies.
