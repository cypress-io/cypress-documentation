# Cypress Accessibility

<AccessibilityAddon />

## What is Cypress Accessibility?

Cypress Accessibility provides organized, visual, and actionable accessibility reports, based completely on the tests you record to Cypress Cloud, and powered by Axe Core® by Deque Systems. This is the documentation page for that product. To learn about the general topic of accessibility testing using the Cypress App, see [our guide on this topic](/app/guides/accessibility-testing).

Cypress Accessibility generates a sortable, filterable report, to see scores and violation counts by page/component, or a combined rule-based report for the entire run. It also includes a drill-in view with live DOM snapshots highlighting each issue detected.

## How are reports created?

Cypress Cloud generates an accessibility report for each unique state reached during your tests on a given Cypress run. This includes pages visited in end-to-end tests, as well as individual components rendered in component tests, and any states or pages that were encountered as a result of interactions performed during test execution.

All of these page or component states are detected using the same protocol that powers [Test Replay](/cloud/features/test-replay), meaning no additional code or setup is needed anywhere in your tests.

These individual accessibility "snapshots" are grouped into page- or component-level reports (called "Views"), and also form the bases of a unified report covering the entire run. This gives you multiple ways to examine your report - by focusing on the most important parts of your application, or by

Reports are generated using the industry-standard open source [Axe Core®](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) library created by Deque Systems, with a default configuration focused on the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

## Highlights

- All steps of all user flows tested in Cypress are captured automatically
- Server-side execution means no disruption to existing test code or practices, and no performance impact from accessibility checks
- Reports are generated at the page or component level, as well as a combined report showing the outcome of all accessibility rules checked in the run
- Debuggable full-page DOM snapshots with highlights are provided for every violation
- Most iframe and Shadow DOM uses cases are supported out-of-the-box
- The [Results API](/accessibility/results-api) allows you to own how your CI pipeline reacts to the accessibility results of the run to implement a policy
- "Ignored" elements are isolated and don't affect your score, but can still be reviewed
