# Get Started

You don't need to make any changes to your code or your test setup. If you record test runs to the Cypress Cloud with Test Replay, you're ready to start using Cypress Accessibility.
You'll start your free trial with personalized support from our sales team and your existing test data to instantly see full accessibility reports for all your Cypress projects.
From there, you can integrate with CI to set your own standards for handling the results.

## 1. Request a trial

Get started with a free trial of Cypress Accessibility. You'll receive a personalized demo using your existing test data to see where testing gaps exist for all of your Cypress projects.

## 2. Record a run

Cypress Accessibility generates reports using [Test Replay](/cloud/features/test-replay) data and requires Cypress v13+. No additional configuration or instrumentation is required to get started.

[Record a run](/cloud/get-started/setup) to the Cypress Cloud with Test Replay to start using Cypress Accessibility.

## 3. View your Accessibility results

After recording a test run, you can view your Accessibility results in the Cypress Cloud via the **Accessibility** tab.

## 4. Customize your results

Cypress Accessibility provides flexible configuration options to customize your reports. You can configure:

- [Element filters](/accessibility/configuration/elementfilters): specify selectors for elements that should be excluded from Accessibility scans
- [View filters](/accessibility/configuration/viewfilters): specify URL patterns for URLs that should be excluded from Accessibility scans. Excluding a URL also excludes all links to that URL.
- [Views](/accessibility/configuration/views): specify URL patterns that represent views

To add or modify the configuration for your project, navigate to the **App Quality** tab in your project settings.
