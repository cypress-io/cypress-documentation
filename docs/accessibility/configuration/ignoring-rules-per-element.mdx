# Ignore rules for specific elements

Cypress Accessibility configuration allows you to exclude [elements](/accessibility/configuration/elementfilters) or whole [pages](/accessibility/configuration/viewfilters) from the accessibility report, but sometimes there are situations where you may want to keep an element in your accessibility report, but ignore some accessibility rules for that element.

This can be accomplished in your application code using the `data-a11y-ignore` attribute, like this:

```html
<button data-a11y-ignore="color-contrast">Log In</button>
```

This would mean that if a color contrast violation was detected on this button, it would be tracked and flagged as an ignored violation in your accessibility report, instead of being listed as a failure. Any other violations detected would be flagged as normal failures.

## Ignore multiple rules

Multiple rules can be ignored by using commas to separate a list of rule IDs:

```html
<button data-a11y-ignore="color-contrast,button-name">Log In</button>
```

## Where to find rule IDs

The "Learn more" link in your accessibility reports will display the ID for each rule. They can also be looked up in the [Axe-CoreÂ® rule documentation](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/rule-descriptions.md) directly.

## When to use this

### Handle false positives

This is most useful when there is a known false positive failure for a specific rule and you want to remove it from your report without losing all other insights about an element.

The `data-a11y-ignore` attribute pattern is used in some libraries like Adobe's React Spectrum, so those UI elements automatically have the defined rules ignored correctly in Cypress Accessibility.

### Avoid blocking a code change

A secondary use case is to avoid certain known issues becoming blocking for a pull request. `data-a11y-ignore` allows for a minimal scope of what to ignore, and creates a paper trail through version control which means these changes are obvious at code review, and comments can be added nearby to explain the reason for ignoring the rule.
