# viewFilters

:::info
Note: setting `viewFilters` impacts both Accessibility and UI Coverage reports.
This cannot be nested.
:::

By default, every URL that is visited within a run is included in the Accessibility report. The `viewFilters` property allows you to specify URL patterns for URLs that should be excluded from Accessibility. Excluding a URL also excludes all links to that URL.

For every URL visited by Cypress in a run and every link element found, the first `viewFilters` rule for which the `pattern` property matches the URL is used to either include or exclude the URL based on the `include` value. URLs that do not match any rules are included by default.

## Syntax <a href="#syntax" id="syntax"></a>

```typescript
{
  "viewFilters": [
    {
      "pattern": string,
      "include": boolean
    }
  ]
}
```
