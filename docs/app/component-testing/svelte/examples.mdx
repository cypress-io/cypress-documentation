## Mounting Components

### Using `cy.mount()`

To mount a component with `cy.mount()`, import the component and pass it to the
method:

```ts
import { Stepper } from './stepper.svelte'

it('mounts', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper)
})
```

### Passing Data to a Component

You can pass props to a component by setting props in the options: `cy.mount()`:

```ts
it('mounts', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper, { props: { count: 100 } })
})
```

### Testing Event Handlers

To test emitted events from a Svelte component, we can use access the component
instances and use `$on` method to listen to events raised. We can also pass in a
Cypress spy so we can query the spy later for results. In the example below, we
listen to the `change` event and validate it was called as expected:

```js
it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  const changeSpy = cy.spy().as('changeSpy')
  cy.mount(Stepper).then(({ component }) => {
    component.$on('change', changeSpy)
  })
  cy.get('[data-cy=increment]').click()
  cy.get('@changeSpy').should('have.been.calledWithMatch', {
    detail: { count: 1 },
  })
})
```

### Accessing the Component Instance

There might be times when you might want to access the component instance
directly in your tests. To do so, use `.then()`, which enables us to work with
the subject that was yielded from the `cy.mount()` command.

```js
cy.mount(Stepper).then(({ component }) => {
  //component is the rendered instance of Stepper
})
```
