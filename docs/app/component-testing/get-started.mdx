### Select Testing Type

Whenever you run Cypress for the first time, the app will prompt you to set up
either E2E Testing or Component Testing. Click on "Component Testing" to start
the configuration wizard.

:::info

For more information on how to choose a testing type, we recommend this [Testing Types Guide](/app/core-concepts/testing-types)

:::

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/component-testing/select-test-type.jpg"
  caption="Choose Component Testing"
/>

### Project Setup

The Project Setup screen will automatically detect your framework and bundler. In this example we will use [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
Click "Next Step" to continue.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/component-testing/project-setup-react.jpg"
  caption="React and Vite are automatically detected"
/>

### Install Dependencies

The next screen checks that all the required dependencies are installed. All the
items should have green checkboxes on them, indicating everything is good, so
click "Continue".

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/component-testing/dependency-detection-react.jpg"
  caption="All necessary dependencies are installed"
/>

### Config Files

Next, Cypress generates all the necessary configuration files and gives you a
list of all the changes it made to your project. Click "Continue".

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/component-testing/scaffolded-files.jpg"
  caption="The Cypress launchpad will scaffold all of these files for you"
/>

### Choose A Browser

After setting up component testing, you will be at the browser selection screen.

Pick the browser of your choice and click the "Start Component Testing" button
to open the Cypress App.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/component-testing/select-browser.jpg"
  caption="Choose your browser"
/>

## Writing Your First Test

At this point, your project is configured to use Cypress Component Testing. However, when the app appears, it won't find any specs because we haven't created
any yet. Now we need write our first Component Test.

<DocsImage src="/img/app/component-testing/create-your-first-spec-cfc.png" />

### Frameworks

Cypress currently has official mounting libraries for
[React](/app/component-testing/react/overview),
[Angular](/app/component-testing/angular/overview),
[Vue](/app/component-testing/vue/overview), and
[Svelte](/app/component-testing/svelte/overview).
In addition to our official framework support there are many community plugins such as
[Qwik](https://github.com/qwikifiers/cypress-qwik) and [Lit](https://github.com/redfox-mx/cypress-lit).

### Your First Component Test

Though every framework is different and has its own unique nuances, in general, writing tests is very similar.
Let's look at how a basic test is written for a `StepperComponent`.

Let's assume the Stepper Component consists of two `buttons`, one used to **decrement** the counter and one
to **increment** it as well as a `span` tag that sits in the middle of the buttons to show the
current value of the counter.

:::info

    cy.mount(Stepper)
  })
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Test Explanation

Let's break down the spec. First, we import the `Stepper` component. Then, we
organize our tests using the functions `describe` and `it`, which allows us to
group tests into sections by using method blocks. These are global functions
provided by Cypress, which means you don't have to import them directly to use
them. The top-level `describe` block will be the container for all our tests in
a file, and each `it` represents an individual test. The `describe` function
takes two parameters, the first of which is the name of the test suite, and the
second is a function that will execute the tests.

We defined a test using the `it` function inside `describe`. The first parameter
to `it` is a brief description of the spec, and the second parameter is a
function that contains the test code. In our example above, we only have one
test, but soon we'll see how we can add multiple `it` blocks inside of a
`describe` for a series of tests.

:::info

The [cy.mount()](/api/commands/mount) method will mount our component into the test
app so we can begin running tests against it.

:::

Now it's time to see the test in action.

## Running the Test

Switch back to the browser you opened for testing, and you should now see the
`Stepper` Component in the spec list. Click it to see the spec execute.

<DocsVideo src="/img/snippets/specs-list.mp4" title="Specs List" />

Our first test verifies the component can mount in its default state without
any errors. If there is a runtime error during test execution, the test will
fail, and you will see a stack trace pointing to the source of the problem.

A basic test like the one above is an excellent way to start testing a
component. Cypress renders your component in a real browser, and you can use all
the techniques/tools you would normally during development, such as interacting
with the component in the test runner, and using the browser dev tools to
inspect and debug both your tests and the component's code.

Feel free to play around with the `Stepper` component by interacting with the
increment and decrement buttons.

Now that the component is mounted, our next step is to test that the behavior of
the component is correct.

### Selectors & Assertions

By default, the Stepper's counter is initialized to "0". We can override that
value by specifying an initial count. Let's write a couple of tests that will
verify both these states.

To do so, we will use a selector to access the `span` element that contains the
counter, and then assert that the text value of the element is what we expect it
to be.

There are various ways to select items from the DOM using Cypress. We will use
[cy.get()](/api/commands/get), which allows us to pass in a CSS-like selector.

After we "get" the element, we use the [should](/api/commands/should) assertion
method to verify it has the correct text value.

Add the following test inside the `describe` block, right below the first test:

<Tabs groupId="frameworks">
<TabItem value="React" active>

```jsx
it('stepper should default to 0', () => {
  cy.mount(<Stepper />)
  cy.get('span').should('have.text', '0')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Angular">

```typescript
it('stepper should default to 0', () => {
  cy.mount(StepperComponent)
  cy.get('span').should('have.text', '0')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Vue">

```js
it('stepper should default to 0', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper)
  cy.get('span').should('have.text', '0')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Svelte">

```js
it('stepper should default to 0', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper)
  cy.get('span').should('have.text', '0')
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you go back to the test runner, you should see the test pass.

In the above test, we select the element by passing in "span" to `cy.get()`,
which will select all `span` tags in our component. We only have one `span`
currently, so this works. However, if our component evolves and we add another
`span`, then this test could start to fail. We should use a selector that will
be less brittle to future changes.

In the `Stepper` component, the `span` tag has a `data-cy` attribute on it:

<Tabs groupId="frameworks">
<TabItem value="React" active>

```jsx
<span data-cy="counter">{count}</span>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Angular">

```html
<span data-cy="counter">{{ count }}</span>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Vue">

```html
<span data-cy="counter">{{ count }}</span>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Svelte">

```html
<span data-cy="counter">{count}</span>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We assign a unique id to the `data-cy` attribute that we can use for testing
purposes. Update the test to use a CSS attribute selector to `cy.get()`:

<Tabs groupId="frameworks">
<TabItem value="React" active>

```jsx
it('stepper should default to 0', () => {
  cy.mount(<Stepper />)
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '0')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Angular">

```typescript
it('stepper should default to 0', () => {
  cy.mount(StepperComponent)
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '0')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Vue">

```js
it('stepper should default to 0', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper)
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '0')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Svelte">

```js
it('stepper should default to 0', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper)
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '0')
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The test will still pass as expected, and our selector is now future-proof. For
more info on writing good selectors, see our guide
[Selector Best Practices](/app/core-concepts/best-practices#Selecting-Elements).

### Passing Props to Components

We should also have a test to ensure the `count` prop sets the count to
something else besides its default value of "0". We can pass in props to the
`Stepper` component like so:

<Tabs groupId="frameworks">
<TabItem value="React" active>

```jsx
it('supports a "count" prop to set the value', () => {
  cy.mount(<Stepper count={100} />)
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '100')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Angular">

```typescript
it('supports a "count" prop to set the value', () => {
  cy.mount(StepperComponent, {
    componentProperties: {
      count: 100,
    },
  })
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '100')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Vue">

```js
it('supports a "count" prop to set the value', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper, { props: { count: 100 } })
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '100')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Svelte">

```js
it('supports a "count" prop to set the value', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper, { props: { count: 100 } })
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '100')
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Testing Interactions

We mounted and selected the element in the above tests but didn't interact with
it. We should also test that the value of the counter changes when a user clicks
the "increment" and "decrement" buttons.

To do so, we will interact with the component by using the
[click()](/api/commands/click) command, which clicks a DOM element just like a
real user would.

Add the following tests:

<Tabs groupId="frameworks">
<TabItem value="React" active>

```jsx
it('when the increment button is pressed, the counter is incremented', () => {
  cy.mount(<Stepper />)
  cy.get('[data-cy=increment]').click()
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '1')
})

it('when the decrement button is pressed, the counter is decremented', () => {
  cy.mount(<Stepper />)
  cy.get('[data-cy=decrement]').click()
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '-1')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Angular">

```typescript
it('when the increment button is pressed, the counter is incremented', () => {
  cy.mount(StepperComponent)
  cy.get('[data-cy=increment]').click()
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '1')
})

it('when the decrement button is pressed, the counter is decremented', () => {
  cy.mount(StepperComponent)
  cy.get('[data-cy=decrement]').click()
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '-1')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Vue">

```js
it('when the increment button is pressed, the counter is incremented', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper)
  cy.get('[data-cy=increment]').click()
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '1')
})

it('when the decrement button is pressed, the counter is decremented', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper)
  cy.get('[data-cy=decrement]').click()
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '-1')
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Svelte">

```js
it('when the increment button is pressed, the counter is incremented', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper)
  cy.get('[data-cy=increment]').click()
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '1')
})

it('when the decrement button is pressed, the counter is decremented', () => {
  cy.mount(Stepper)
  cy.get('[data-cy=decrement]').click()
  cy.get('[data-cy=counter]').should('have.text', '-1')
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you view the results of each of the tests, you will see that the counter is
now "1" in the **increment** test, and "-1" in the **decrement** test. Not only did our
tests pass, but we can visually see the results in a browser!

## Testing Components with Events

All the state of the `Stepper` Component (ie: the count) is handled internally in the
component and then consumers are then alerted to changes to the state.

As the developer of the `Stepper` Component, you want to make sure when the
end-user clicks the **increment** and **decrement** buttons, that the appropriate event is
triggered with the proper values in the consuming component.

### Using Spies

We can use [Cypress Spies](/app/guides/stubs-spies-and-clocks#Spies) to
validate these events are being called correctly. A spy is a special function that
keeps track of how many times it was called and any parameters that it was
called with. We can then assign a spy to our event, interact with the
component, and then query the spy to validate it was called with the parameters
we expect.

Let's set up the spies and bind them to the component:

<Tabs groupId="frameworks">
<TabItem value="React" active>

```jsx
it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  const onChangeSpy = cy.spy().as('onChangeSpy')
  cy.mount(<Stepper onChange={onChangeSpy} />)
  cy.get('[data-cy=increment]').click()
  cy.get('@onChangeSpy').should('have.been.calledWith', 1)
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Angular">

```typescript
it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  const onChangeSpy = cy.spy().as('onChangeSpy')
  cy.mount(StepperComponent, {
    componentProperties: {
      change: {
        emit: onChangeSpy,
      } as any,
    },
  })
  cy.get('[data-cy=increment]').click()
  cy.get('@changeSpy').should('have.been.calledWith', 1)
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Vue">

```js
it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  const onChangeSpy = cy.spy().as('onChangeSpy')
  cy.mount(Stepper, { props: { onChange: onChangeSpy } })
  cy.get('[data-cy=increment]').click()
  cy.get('@onChangeSpy').should('have.been.calledWith', 1)
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Svelte">

```js
it('clicking + fires a change event with the incremented value', () => {
  const changeSpy = cy.spy().as('changeSpy')
  cy.mount(Stepper).then(({ component }) => {
    component.$on('change', changeSpy)
  })
  cy.get('[data-cy=increment]').click()
  cy.get('@changeSpy').should('have.been.calledWithMatch', {
    detail: { count: 1 },
  })
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

First, we create a new spy by calling the `cy.spy()` method. We pass in a string
that gives the spy an [alias](/app/core-concepts/variables-and-aliases),
which assigns the spy a name by which we can reference it later. In
`cy.mount()`, we initialize the component and pass the spy into it. After that,
we click the increment button.

The next line is a bit different. We've seen how we can use the `cy.get()`
method to select elements, but we can also use it to grab any aliases we've set
up previously. We use `cy.get()` to grab the alias to the spy (by prepending an
"@" to the alias name). We assert that the method was called with the expected
value.

With that, the `Stepper` component is well tested. Nice job!
