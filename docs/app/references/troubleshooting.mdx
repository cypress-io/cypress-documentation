:::

## Start here

There are times when you will encounter errors or unexpected behavior with
Cypress itself. This guide recommends some resources and steps to take to
troubleshoot those problems.

### Update Cypress

We always recommend using the latest version of the Cypress App. If you're not using the
latest version, upgrade to the [latest version](/app/references/changelog). Your issue may already be
resolved.

### Support channels

Check these support resources for Cypress App issues:

- Connect with our community in [Discord](https://on.cypress.io/discord)
- Search existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues)
- Search this documentation (search is in the top right) üòâ
- Search [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cypress)
  for relevant answers
- If you still haven't found a solution,
  [open an issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/new/choose) _with
  a reproducible example_.

If your organization signs up for one of our
[paid plans](https://www.cypress.io/pricing/), you can get dedicated email
support, which gives you one-on-one help from our team.

### Isolate the Problem

When debugging a failing test, follow these general principles to isolate the
problem:

- Look at the screenshots, video, or [Test Replay](/cloud/features/test-replay) of the test. Test Replay will show you the exact steps that were taken during the test including
  console logs and requests.
- Split large spec files into smaller ones.
- Split long tests into smaller tests.
- Run the same test in different browsers to isolate the problem to a specific browser.
- Run the same test in different environments (local, CI, etc.) to isolate the problem to a specific environment.
- Reduce the test to the smallest possible test that still reproduces the problem.

## Troubleshooting Steps

Below are some steps you can take to troubleshoot common issues with Cypress.

### Clear Cypress cache

If you're having an issue during installation of Cypress, try removing the
contents of the Cypress cache.

This will clear out all installed versions of Cypress that may be cached on your
machine.

```shell
cypress cache clear
```

After running this command, you will need to run `cypress install` before
running Cypress again.

<CypressInstallCommands />

### Allow the Cypress Chrome extension

Cypress utilizes a Chrome extension in order to run properly. If you or your
company block specific Chrome extensions, this may cause problems with running
Cypress. You will want to ask your administrator to allow the Cypress extension
ID below:

```sh
caljajdfkjjjdehjdoimjkkakekklcck
```

You can check the current company policies for your Chrome installation by typing `chrome://policy` into the address bar and pressing Enter.

### Allow Cypress URLs on VPNs

To send the data and results of your tests to
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud-introduction), Cypress needs free
access to some URLs.

<UrlAllowList />

### Clear App Data

Cypress maintains some local application data in order to save user preferences
and more quickly start up. Sometimes this data can become corrupted. You may fix
an issue you have by clearing this app data.

#### To clear App Data

1. Open Cypress via `cypress open`
2. Go to `Developer Tools` -> `View App Data`
3. This will take you to the directory in your file system where your App Data
   is stored. If you cannot open Cypress, search your file system for a
   directory named `cy` whose content should look something like this:

```text
üìÇ production
  üìÑ all.log
  üìÅ browsers
  üìÅ bundles
  üìÑ cache
  üìÅ projects
  üìÅ proxy
  üìÑ state.json
```

4. Delete everything in the `cy` folder
5. Close Cypress and open it up again

### Print DEBUG logs

Cypress utilizes the [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug) module.
That means you can receive helpful debugging output by running Cypress with a system-level environment variable `DEBUG` set to `cypress:*` prior to running `cypress run` or `cypress open`.

:::tip

Enabling debug output can generate a large amount of data. This may also impact performance.
Only enable debug output when you need it.

To reduce the amount of debug output data generated, replace `cypress:*` using a more selective value for `DEBUG`.
See below, including the section [Log sources](#Log-sources).

If you need to share debug output collected in a file, consider first compressing it with a [ZIP](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)>) utility or similar to reduce the file size before sharing.

:::

**On macOS, Linux or Windows (Git Bash):**

<Tabs groupId="package-manager"
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress run
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
DEBUG=cypress:* yarn cypress run
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```shell
DEBUG=cypress:* pnpm cypress run
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can change `run` to `open` in the above to capture debug logs when starting your tests from the [Cypress Specs](../core-concepts/open-mode#Specs) UI.

For non-POSIX type shells on Windows, set the `DEBUG` environment variable as follows. (Replace `npx` with `yarn` or `pnpm` if you are using Yarn or pnpm package managers instead of npm.)

**On Windows CMD:**

```shell
set DEBUG=cypress:*
npx cypress run
```

**On Windows PowerShell:**

```shell
$env:DEBUG='cypress:*'
npx cypress run
```

If you have issues with the logs not printing, it may be a permissions issue
with setting the environment variable in your terminal. You may need to run your
terminal in administrative mode or review your permission settings.

[How to run Cypress CLI commands](/app/references/command-line#How-to-run-commands) provides background information on running Cypress from the command line and includes a reference of additional command line options.

#### Detailed Logs

There are several levels of `DEBUG` messages

```shell
## prints very few top-level messages
DEBUG=cypress:server ...
## prints ALL messages from server package
DEBUG=cypress:server* ...
## prints messages only from project base operations
DEBUG=cypress:server:project ...
```

This allows you to isolate the problem a little better

#### Log sources

Cypress is built from multiple packages, each responsible for its own logging:
server, reporter, driver, command line, etc. Each package writes debug logs
under a different source. Here are a few common log sources and when you might
want to enable them

| Set `DEBUG` to value             | To enable debugging                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cypress:*`                      | ALL modules                                                   |
| `cypress:cli*`                   | Top-level command line parsing and binary installation        |
| `cypress:server:args`            | Incorrect parsed command line arguments                       |
| `cypress:data-context:sources:*` | Not finding the expected project data                         |
| `cypress:server:project`         | Opening the project                                           |
| `cypress:server:browsers*`       | Finding installed browsers                                    |
| `cypress:launcher:*`             | Launching the found browser                                   |
| `cypress:server:video`           | Video recording                                               |
| `cypress:network:*`              | Adding network interceptors                                   |
| `cypress:net-stubbing:*`         | Network interception in the proxy layer                       |
| `cypress:server:reporter`        | Problems with test reporters                                  |
| `cypress:server:preprocessor`    | Processing specs                                              |
| `cypress:server:socket-e2e`      | Watching spec files                                           |
| `cypress:server:task`            | Invoking the `cy.task()` command                              |
| `cypress:server:socket-base`     | Debugging `cy.request()` command                              |
| `cypress:webpack`                | Bundling specs using webpack                                  |
| `cypress:server:fixture`         | Loading fixture files                                         |
| `cypress:server:record:ci-info`  | Git commit and CI information when recording to Cypress Cloud |

You can combine several areas together using the comma character. For example,
to debug specs not being found, use:

```shell
## see how CLI arguments were parsed
## and how Cypress tried to locate spec files
DEBUG=cypress:cli,cypress:data-context:sources:FileDataSource,cypress:data-context:sources:ProjectDataSource npx cypress run --spec ...
```

You can also exclude a log source using the `-` character. For example, to see all
`cypress:server*` messages without noisy browser messages use:

```shell
DEBUG=cypress:server*,-cypress:server:browsers* npx cypress run
```

#### Debug log depth

Sometimes the logged object has deeply nested properties and is shown as
`[Object]` instead of the full serialization.

```shell
DEBUG=cypress:server:socket-base npx cypress run

cypress:server:socket-base backend:request { eventName: 'http:request', args:
  [ { url: 'http://localhost:7065/echo', method: 'POST', body: [Object], auth: [Object],
  json: true, encoding: 'utf8', gzip: true, timeout: 30000, followRedirect: true,
  failOnStatusCode: true, retryOnNetworkFailure: true,
  retryOnStatusCodeFailure: false } ] } +5ms
```

You can increase the printed object depth using the `DEBUG_DEPTH` environment
variable

```shell
DEBUG=cypress:server:socket-base DEBUG_DEPTH=3 npx cypress run

cypress:server:socket-base backend:request { eventName: 'http:request', args:
  [ { url: 'http://localhost:7065/echo', method: 'POST', body: { text: 'ping!' },
  auth: { username: 'jane.lane', password: 'password123' }, json: true, encoding: 'utf8',
  gzip: true, timeout: 30000, followRedirect: true, failOnStatusCode: true,
  retryOnNetworkFailure: true, retryOnStatusCodeFailure: false } ] } +4ms
```

#### 3rd party modules

Some 3rd party modules like
[@cypress/request](https://github.com/cypress-io/request) output additional log
messages by inspecting the `NODE_DEBUG` environment variable. For example to
debug the network interception and the requests made by the `@cypress/request` module
use:

```shell
DEBUG=cypress:net-stubbing:server:intercept-request \
  NODE_DEBUG=request npx cypress run
```

#### Debug logs in the browser

If the problem is seen during `cypress open` you can print debug logs in the
browser too. Open the browser's Developer Tools and set a `localStorage`
property:

```javascript
localStorage.debug = 'cypress*'

// to disable debug messages
delete localStorage.debug
```

Reload the browser and turn on 'Verbose' logs to see debug messages within the
Developer Tools console. You will only see the **cypress\:driver** package logs
that run in the browser, as you can see below.

<DocsImage src="/img/api/debug/debug-driver.jpg" alt="Debug logs in browser" />

### Log memory and CPU usage

You can tell Cypress to log out a summary of the memory and CPU usage of itself
and any subprocesses at a regular interval by enabling the
`cypress:server:util:process_profiler` debug stream, like so:

```shell
DEBUG=cypress:server:util:process_profiler npx cypress run
```

(See [Print DEBUG Logs](#Print-DEBUG-logs) above for hints on setting
the `DEBUG` environment variable in a non-POSIX Windows terminal.)

In the resulting output, processes are grouped by their name.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-cypress-process-profiler-cli.jpg"
  alt="Process printout of Cypress in CLI"
/>

By default, process information is collected, summarized and is printed once
every 10 seconds. You can override this interval by setting the
`CYPRESS_PROCESS_PROFILER_INTERVAL` environment variable to the desired interval
in milliseconds.

You can also obtain more detailed per-process information by enabling the
verbose `cypress-verbose:server:util:process_profiler` debug stream.

### Disable the Command Log

In some cases the [Command Log](/app/core-concepts/open-mode#Command-Log),
responsible for displaying test commands, assertions, and statuses in the
Cypress Test Runner, may cause performance issues resulting in slower tests or
the browser crashing.

In order to isolate these issues, you can hide the Command Log by passing the
environment variable below during `cypress open` or `cypress run`.

```shell
CYPRESS_NO_COMMAND_LOG=1 cypress run
```

You can also hide the entire Cypress Runner UI in `cypress run` by passing the [`--no-runner-ui`](/app/references/command-line#cypress-run-no-runner-ui) command line flag.

```shell
npx cypress run --no-runner-ui
```

With this variable set, Cypress will skip rendering the Command Log entirely,
and perform none of the usual DOM updates to display information about commands
and statuses as the test runs.

**Note:** With this variable set, screenshots and videos will not include the
Command Log.

### Download specific Chrome version

The Chrome browser is evergreen - meaning it will automatically update itself,
sometimes causing a breaking change in your automated tests.
You can use the information in [Download Chromium](https://on.cypress.io/chromium-downloads) to download a
specific released version of Chromium for every platform.

## Specific Issues

### Launching browsers

Cypress attempts to
[automatically find installed Chrome versions for you](/app/references/launching-browsers).
However, probing for browsers across different environments can be error-prone.
If Cypress cannot find a browser but you know you have it installed, there are
ways to ensure that Cypress can "see" it.

:::info

<strong>Using the `--browser` command line argument</strong>

You can also supply the `--browser` command line argument to launch a browser
from a known filesystem path to bypass browser auto detection.
[See 'Launching Browsers' for more information](/app/references/launching-browsers#Launching-by-a-path)

:::

You can see the full list of found browsers and their properties within the
[resolved configuration](/app/references/configuration#Resolved-Configuration)
in the **Settings** tab of Cypress.

Another way to log what is found by Cypress is to run Cypress with the
[DEBUG environment variable](#Print-DEBUG-logs) set to `cypress:launcher:*`. This
will print information about the found browsers and their properties to the
terminal.

**Tip:** use the [cypress info](/app/references/command-line#cypress-info)
command to see all locally detected browsers.

#### Mac

On Mac, Cypress attempts to find installed browsers by their bundle identifier.
If this does not succeed, it will fall back to the Linux browser detection
method.

| Browser Name         | Expected Bundle Identifier            | Expected Executable Path                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chrome`             | `com.google.Chrome`                   | `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`                         |
| `chrome:beta`        | `com.google.Chrome.beta`              | `/Applications/Google Chrome Beta.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome Beta`               |
| `chrome:canary`      | `com.google.Chrome.canary`            | `/Applications/Google Chrome Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome Canary`           |
| `chrome-for-testing` | `com.google.chrome.for.testing`       | `/Applications/Google Chrome for Testing.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome for Testing` |
| `chromium`           | `org.chromium.Chromium`               | `/Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium`                                   |
| `firefox`            | `org.mozilla.firefox`                 | `/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox`                                     |
| `firefox:dev`        | `org.mozilla.firefoxdeveloperedition` | `/Applications/Firefox Developer Edition.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox`                   |
| `firefox:nightly`    | `org.mozilla.nightly`                 | `/Applications/Firefox Nightly.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox`                             |
| `edge`               | `com.microsoft.Edge`                  | `/Applications/Microsoft Edge.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Edge`                       |
| `edge:beta`          | `com.microsoft.Edge.Beta`             | `/Applications/Microsoft Edge Beta.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Edge Beta`             |
| `edge:canary`        | `com.microsoft.Edge.Canary`           | `/Applications/Microsoft Edge Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Edge Canary`         |
| `edge:dev`           | `com.microsoft.Edge.Dev`              | `/Applications/Microsoft Edge Dev.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Edge Dev`               |

For the current list, see
[packages/launcher](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/launcher/lib/darwin/index.ts)
files.

**Note:** `chrome-for-testing` and `chromium` typically require the downloaded application file to be manually moved to the `/Applications` folder to be auto-detected.

#### Linux

On Linux, Cypress scans your `PATH` for a number of different binary names. If
the browser you are trying to use does not exist under one of the expected
binary names, Cypress will not be able to find it.

| Browser Name         | Expected Binary Name(s)                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `chrome`             | `google-chrome`, `chrome`, or `google-chrome-stable` |
| `chrome:beta`        | `google-chrome-beta`                                 |
| `chrome:canary`      | `google-chrome-canary`                               |
| `chrome-for-testing` | `chrome`                                             |
| `chromium`           | `chromium-browser` or `chromium`                     |
| `firefox`            | `firefox`                                            |
| `firefox:dev`        | `firefox-developer-edition`, `firefox`               |
| `firefox:nightly`    | `firefox-nightly`, `firefox-trunk`                   |
| `edge`               | `edge`, `microsoft-edge`                             |
| `edge:beta`          | `edge-beta`, `microsoft-edge-beta`                   |
| `edge:canary`        | `edge-canary`, `microsoft-edge-canary`               |
| `edge:dev`           | `edge-dev`, `microsoft-edge-dev`                     |

These binary names should work for most Linux distributions. If your
distribution packages browsers under a different binary name, you can add a
symlink using the expected binary name so that Cypress can detect it.

For example, to create a symlink for the `chrome-for-testing` browser:

```shell
sudo ln -s /path/to/binary/chrome /usr/local/bin/chrome
```

**Note:** `chrome-for-testing` and `chromium` typically require the binary to be manually added to the `PATH` or a symlink created to be auto-detected.

#### Windows

On Windows, Cypress scans the following locations to try to find each browser:

| Browser Name         | Expected Executable Path                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `chrome:beta`        | `C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome Beta/Application/chrome.exe`, `C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome Beta/Application/chrome.exe`                                                                             |
| `chrome:canary`      | `%APPDATA%/Local/Google/Chrome SxS/Application/chrome.exe`                                                                                                                                                   |

files.

To make a browser installed at a different path be auto-detected, create a
symlink using `mklink` in the location that Cypress expects to find your
browser.

For example, to create a symlink for the `chrome-for-testing` browser:

```shell
mklink /d "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome for Testing" "C:\path\to\chrome\executable\folder"
```

**Note:** `chrome-for-testing` and `chromium` typically require the downloaded folder to either be moved and renamed to the location mentioned above or a symlink created as described above to be auto-detected.

Occasionally Cypress will have issues detecting the type of browser in Windows
environments. To manually detect the browser type, append the browser type to
the end of the path:

```shell
cypress open --browser C:/User/Application/browser.exe:chrome
```

## Hacking on Cypress

If you want to dive into Cypress and edit the code yourself, you can do that.
The Cypress code is open source and licensed under an
[MIT license](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/LICENSE). There
are a few tips on getting started that we've outlined below.

### Contribute

If you'd like to contribute directly to the Cypress code, we'd love to have your
help! Please check out our
[contributing guide](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to learn about the many ways you can contribute.

### Run Cypress by itself

Cypress comes with an npm CLI module that parses the arguments, starts the Xvfb
server (if necessary), and then opens Cypress.

Some common situations on why you would want to run Cypress by itself are to:

- debug Cypress not starting or hanging
- debug problems related to the way CLI arguments are parsed by the npm CLI
  module

Here is how you can launch Cypress directly without the npm CLI module. First,
find where Cypress binary versions are installed using the
[cypress cache path](/app/references/command-line#cypress-cache-path) and
[cypress cache list](/app/references/command-line#cypress-cache-list) commands.

An example on a Linux machine shows:

```text
$ npx cypress cache path
/home/<username>/.cache/Cypress
$ npx cypress cache list
```

| version | last used   |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 13.15.0 | 12 days ago |

You can replace the Linux `/home/<username>` directory with the `~` character in the following example steps.

Second, try a smoke test that verifies that the application has all its required
dependencies present on the host machine. Ignore the warning about running the Cypress binary directly.

```text
$ ~/.cache/Cypress/13.15.0/Cypress/Cypress --smoke-test --ping=101

DevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:39737/devtools/browser/162ad33c-294b-460b-812e-cc317907ac86
It looks like you are running the Cypress binary directly.

This is not the recommended approach, and Cypress may not work correctly.

Please install the cypress NPM package and follow the instructions here:

https://on.cypress.io/install-cypress
101
```

If there is a missing dependency, the smoke test will fail to run and the application will print an error message
referring to [Linux Prerequisites](/app/get-started/install-cypress#Linux-Prerequisites).
Follow the instructions to ensure all required dependencies are installed.

To troubleshoot missing shared library dependencies on Linux, use the `ldd` command on the Cypress binary.
A missing dependency should be identified with "not found" in the output.

```text
ldd ~/.cache/Cypress/13.15.0/Cypress/Cypress
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe0e7db000)
	libffmpeg.so => /home/<username>/.cache/Cypress/13.15.0/Cypress/libffmpeg.so (0x0000774bc7a00000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x0000774bd26d0000)
	libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x0000774bd26cb000)
	libgobject-2.0.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgobject-2.0.so.0 (0x0000774bd2668000)
	libglib-2.0.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0 (0x0000774bd251f000)
	libgio-2.0.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgio-2.0.so.0 (0x0000774bc7e30000)
	libnss3.so => not found
  ...
```

**Tip:** If you are having problems with dependencies, use a [Cypress Docker image](/app/get-started/install-cypress#Docker-Prerequisites). These have all Cypress dependencies pre-installed.

On Ubuntu `24.04` you may receive a fatal error including the text `FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc` due to added security in this version of Ubuntu.
Refer to the [Ubuntu 24.04 Release notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-notes/39890) in the section [Unprivileged user namespace restrictions](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-notes/39890#unprivileged-user-namespace-restrictions-15) and apply one of the workarounds to disable unprivileged user namespace restrictions for the entire system, either for one boot or persistently, as described.

Alternatively you can follow the instructions in the error message similar to:

> You need to make sure that `/home/<username>/.cache/Cypress/13.15.0/Cypress/chrome-sandbox` is owned by root and has mode 4755.

and execute for example:

```shell
sudo chown root:root ~/.cache/Cypress/13.15.0/Cypress/chrome-sandbox
sudo chmod +4755 ~/.cache/Cypress/13.15.0/Cypress/chrome-sandbox
```

You can see the Electron verbose log messages by setting an
[environment variable ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/command-line-switches).

**Note:** Verbose Electron logging might show warnings that still allow Cypress
to work normally. For example, the following Bluetooth related warning can be ignored:

> WARNING:bluez_dbus_manager.cc

```text
ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=true ~/.cache/Cypress/13.15.0/Cypress/Cypress --smoke-test --ping=101

DevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:33161/devtools/browser/1f8a2d15-ea42-403f-8eb4-757f1a9d0b25
[3959:1005/201139.970068:WARNING:bluez_dbus_manager.cc(247)] Floss manager not present, cannot set Floss enable/disable.
It looks like you are running the Cypress binary directly.

This is not the recommended approach, and Cypress may not work correctly.

Please install the cypress NPM package and follow the instructions here:

https://on.cypress.io/install-cypress
101
```

You can also see Cypress debug logs by setting an
[environment variable `DEBUG=cypress:*`](#Print-DEBUG-logs).

```text
$ DEBUG=cypress:* ~/.cache/Cypress/13.15.0/Cypress/Cypress --smoke-test --ping=101

```

If the smoke test does not show a specific error yet crashes, try printing the
Electron crash stack to maybe pinpoint the problem better:

```shell

### Patch Cypress

Cypress comes with an npm CLI module that parses the arguments, starts the Xvfb
server (if necessary), and then opens Cypress.

If you're encountering a bug in the current version of Cypress, you can
implement a temporary fix by patching Cypress in your own project. Here is an
example of how to do this.

1. Install [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package).
2. Add a patch step to your CI configuration after installing your npm packages.

```yaml
- run: npm ci
- run: npx patch-package
```

Alternatively, you can apply the patch during a post-install phase. In your
`package.json`, for example, you could add the following:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "patch-package"
  }
}
```

3. Edit the line causing the problem _in your local node_modules folder_ within
   `node_modules/cypress`.
4. Run the `npx patch-package cypress` command. This command will create a new
   file named after the current Cypress version, for example, `patches/cypress+13.15.0.patch`.

```css
npx patch-package cypress
patch-package 8.0.0
‚Ä¢ Creating temporary folder
‚Ä¢ Installing cypress@13.15.0 with npm
‚Ä¢ Diffing your files with clean files
‚úî Created file patches/cypress+13.15.0.patch

üí° cypress is on GitHub! To draft an issue based on your patch run

    npx patch-package cypress --create-issue
```

5. Commit the new `patches` folder to git.

:::info

If you find a patch for an error,
please add a comment to the relevant Cypress GitHub issue explaining your workaround.
It can help us release an official fix faster.
Alternatively you can use the following command to create a new issue based on your patch contents.

```shell
npx patch-package cypress --create-issue
```
