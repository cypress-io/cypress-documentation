title: Trade-offs
e2eSpecific: true

Cypress automates the browser with its own unique architecture. While this
unlocks the power to do things you will not find anywhere else, there are
specific trade-offs that are made.

In this guide we'll lay out what some of the trade-offs are - and specifically
how you can work around them.

While at first it may seem like these are strict limitations in Cypress - we
think you will soon realize that many of these boundaries are actually **good**
to have. In a sense they prevent you from writing bad, slow, or flaky tests.

#### Permanent trade-offs:

- Cypress is not a general purpose [automation tool](#Automation-restrictions).
- Cypress commands run [inside of a browser](#Inside-the-browser).
- You cannot use Cypress to drive
  [two browsers at the same time](#Multiple-browsers-open-at-the-same-time).
- Each test is bound to a single superdomain. Cross-origin navigation inside
  tests can be enabled by using the [`cy.origin`](/api/commands/origin) command.
  Please read our
  [Cross Origin Testing Guide](/app/guides/cross-origin-testing).

#### Temporary trade-offs:

We want to highlight some _temporary_ restrictions that Cypress hopes to
eventually address.

- [Workarounds for the lack of a `cy.hover()` command.](/api/commands/hover)
- [`cy.tab()` command.](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/299)
- [There is not any native or mobile events support.](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/311#issuecomment-339824191)
- [iframe support is somewhat limited, but does work.](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/136)

## Permanent trade-offs

### Automation restrictions

The Cypress App is a specialized tool that does end-to-end, component, and API
testing really well. We don't think Cypress is the optimal tool for things such as:

- Indexing the web
- Spidering links
- Performance testing
- Scripting 3rd party sites

There are other excellent tools that are optimized for doing each item listed
above.

The **sweet spot** of Cypress is to be used as a tool to test your own
application.

### Inside the browser

In case you missed it before - Cypress tests run inside of the browser! This
means we can do things nobody else can. There is no object serialization or JSON
wire protocols. You have real, native access to everything in your application
under test.

But this also means that your test code **is being evaluated inside the
browser**. Test code is not evaluated in Node, or any other server side
language. The **only** language we'll ever support is the language of the web:
JavaScript.

This trade-off means it makes it a little bit more challenging to communicate with the
back end - like your server or database. You will not be able to connect or
`import` those server-side libraries or modules directly. Although you can require
`node_modules` which can be used in the browser. Additionally, you have the
ability to use Node to import or talk directly to your back end scripts using
[our Plugins API](/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin) or
[cy.task()](/api/commands/task).

To talk to your database or server you need to use the
[`cy.exec()`](/api/commands/exec), [`cy.task()`](/api/commands/task), or
[`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) commands. That means you will need to
expose a way to seed and setup your database. It might take a bit more elbow grease
than other testing tools written in your back end language.

The trade-off here is that doing everything in the browser is a much better
experience in Cypress. But doing things outside of
the browser may take a little extra work.

### Multiple browsers open at the same time

Cypress does not support controlling more than 1 open browser at a time.
You can test multiple tabs, however, using our [@cypress/puppeteer](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/puppeteer) plugin.

With that said, except in the most unusual and rare circumstances, you can still
test most application behavior without opening multiple browsers at the same
time.

You may ask about this functionality like this:

> time with Cypress?

Whether you are testing a chat application or anything else - what you are
really asking about is testing collaboration. But, **you don't need to recreate
the entire environment in order to test collaboration with 100% coverage**.

Doing it this way can be faster, more accurate, and more scalable.

While outside the scope of this article, you could test a chat application using
the following principles. Each one will incrementally introduce more
collaboration:

#### 1. Use only the browser:

```text
    ↓
← browser →
    ↑
```

Avoid the server, invoke your JavaScript callbacks manually thereby simulating
what happens when "notifications come in", or "users leave the chat" purely in
the browser.

You can [stub](/api/commands/stub) everything and simulate every single
scenario. Chat messages, offline messages, connections, reconnections,
disconnections, group chat, etc. Everything that happens inside of the browser
can be fully tested. Requests leaving the browser could also be stubbed and you
could assert that the request bodies were correct.

#### 2. Stub the other connection:

```text
server → browser
            ↓
server ← browser
  ↓
(other connections stubbed)
  ↓
server → browser
```

Use your server to receive messages from the browser, and simulate "the other
participant" by sending messages as that participant. This is certainly
application specific, but generally you could insert records into the database
or do whatever it takes for your server to act as if a message of one client
needs to be sent back to the browser.

Typically this pattern enables you to avoid making a secondary WebSocket
connection and yet still fulfills the bidirectional browser and server contract.
This means you could also test edge cases (disconnections, etc) without actually
handling real connections.

#### 3: Introduce another connection:

```text
server → browser
            ↓
server ← browser
  ↓
server → other connection
            ↓
server ← other connection
  ↓
server → browser
```

To do this - you would need a background process outside of the browser to make
the underlying WebSocket connection that you can then communicate with and
control.

You can do this in many ways and here is an example of using an HTTP server to
act as the client and exposing a REST interface that enables us to control it.

```js
// Cypress tests

// tell the http server at 8081 to connect to 8080
cy.request('http://localhost:8081/connect?url=http://localhost:8080')

// tell the http server at 8081 to send a message
cy.request('http://localhost:8081/message?m=hello')

// tell the http server at 8081 to disconnect
cy.request('http://localhost:8081/disconnect')
```

And the HTTP server code would look something like this...

```js
const client = require('socket.io:client')
const express = require('express')

const app = express()

let socket

app.get('/connect', (req, res) => {
  const url = req.query.url

  socket = client(url)

  socket.on('connect', () => {
    res.sendStatus(200)
  })
})

app.get('/message', (req, res) => {
  const msg = req.query.m

  socket.send(msg, () => {
    res.sendStatus(200)
  })
})

app.get('/disconnect', (req, res) => {
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    res.sendStatus(200)
  })

  socket.disconnect()
})

app.listen(8081, () => {})
```

This avoids ever needing a second open browser, but still gives you an
end-to-end test that provides 100% confidence that the two clients can
communicate with each other.
