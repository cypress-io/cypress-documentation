Cypress maintains a curated list of plugins created by us and the community.
Plugins from our [official list](/app/plugins/plugins-list) are npm modules. This enables them to
be versioned and updated separately without needing to update Cypress itself.

You can install any published plugin using npm:

```shell
npm install <plugin name> --save-dev
```

## Using a plugin

Add your plugin to the
[`setupNodeEvents`](/app/references/configuration#setupNodeEvents)
function in the [Cypress configuration](/app/references/configuration). Please follow any additional instructions provided by the plugin's documentation.
Here's an example of what this might look like:

:::cypress-config-plugin-example

```ts
// bind to the event we care about
on('<event>', (arg1, arg2) => {
  // plugin stuff here
})
```

For information on writing plugins, please check out our
[Overview of Node Events](/api/node-events/overview).
