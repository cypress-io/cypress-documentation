Cypress Cloud provides four distinct Smart Orchestration features for use in CI
to speed up test runs, accelerate debugging workflows, and reduce costs:

- [Parallelization](/app/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization): Reduce
  test duration by running multiple test spec files simultaneously across
  available CI machines.
- [Load Balancing](/app/cloud/smart-orchestration/load-balancing): Optimize
  CI resources and minimize test duration by intelligently prioritizing running
  of test spec files during parallelization.
- [Spec Prioritization](/app/cloud/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization):
  Quickly verify that your latest changes fixed a build by prioritizing the
  specs that failed in the previous Cypress run.
- [Auto Cancellation](/app/cloud/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation):
  Automatically cancel a Cypress run when tests fail. Canceling tests
  early reduces the number of “tests recorded” and thus your
  monthly bill as you won't be billed for tests that aren't valuable once your run
  has failed. This will also free up CI resources for validating fixes, and helping other users.
