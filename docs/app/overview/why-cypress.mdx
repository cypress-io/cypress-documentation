## In a nutshell

Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web.
We address the key pain points teams
face when testing modern applications and maintaining test suites.

We make it possible to:

- [Set up tests](#Set-up-tests)
- [Write tests](#Write-tests)
- [Run tests](#Run-tests)
- [Debug Tests](#Debug-tests)
- [Integrate with CI](#Integrate-with-CI)
- [Optimize your Test Suite](#Optimize-your-Test-Suite)
- [Replay Tests](#Replay-Tests)
- [Integrate into your workflow](#Integrate-into-your-workflow)
- [Analyze Testing Trends](#Analyze-Testing-Trends)

Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both
fundamentally and architecturally different. [See our comparison of Cypress vs Selenium](https://www.cypress.io/comparison/selenium).

## Who uses Cypress?

Our users are typically developers, QA engineers, and teams looking to build web applications
and increase the quality of their existing applications.

Cypress provides solutions for:

- [End-to-end testing](/app/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test)
- [Component testing](/app/component-testing/overview)
- Accessibility testing
- UI Coverage

Cypress can test anything that runs in a browser and surface insights into how to improve the health
of your test suite and the quality of your application.

## Cypress ecosystem

Cypress consists of a free,
[open source](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress),
[locally installed](/app/getting-started/installing-cypress) app
**and** [Cypress Cloud](/cloud/introduction) for recording tests, surfacing test results, and providing test analytics.
Additionally, the Cypress Cloud provides add-ons for Cypress Accessibility and UI Coverage.

- **First:** Cypress helps you set up and start writing tests every day while
  you build your application locally. _TDD at its best!_
- **Next:** After building up a suite of tests and
  [integrating Cypress](/app/continuous-integration/introduction) with your
  CI Provider, [Cypress Cloud](/cloud/introduction) can record your test
  runs surfacing exactly what happened during the test in [Test Replay](/cloud/test-replay).
  You'll never have to wonder: _Why did this fail?_
- **Finally:** Add on Cypress Accessibility to ensure your application is
  accessible to all users, and Cypress UI Coverage to ensure you have tested
  every part of your application.

## Our mission

Our mission is to build a thriving testing solution that enhances
productivity, makes testing an enjoyable experience, and generates developer
happiness. We hold ourselves accountable to champion a testing process **that
actually works**.

We believe our documentation should be approachable. This means enabling our
readers to understand fully not just the **what** but the **why** as well.

We want to help developers build a new generation of modern applications faster,
better, and without the stress and anxiety associated with managing tests. We
aim to elevate the art of software development by leveraging test results to
generate actionable insights for long-term stability by proactively identifying
areas for improvement.

We know that in order for us to be successful we must enable, nurture, and
foster an ecosystem that thrives on open source. Every line of test code is an
investment in **your codebase**, it will never be coupled to us as a paid
service or company. Tests will be able to run and work independently, _always_.

We believe testing needs a lot of ❤️ and we are here to build a tool, a service,
and a community that everyone can learn and benefit from. We're solving the
hardest pain points shared by every developer working on the web. We believe in
this mission and hope that you will join us to make Cypress a lasting ecosystem
that makes everyone happy.

## Features

Cypress comes fully baked, batteries included. Here is a list of things it can
do:

#### Cypress App

- **Time Travel:** Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Hover over
  commands in the [Command Log](/app/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log)
  to see exactly what happened at each step.
- **Debuggability:** Stop guessing why your tests are failing.
  [Debug directly](/app/guides/debugging) from familiar tools like Developer
  Tools. Our readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.
- **Automatic Waiting:** Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress
  [automatically waits](/app/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Cypress-is-Not-Like-jQuery)
  for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.
- **Spies, Stubs, and Clocks:** Verify and
  [control the behavior](/app/guides/stubs-spies-and-clocks) of functions,
  server responses, or timers. The same functionality you love from unit testing
  is right at your fingertips.
- **Network Traffic Control:** Easily
  [control, stub, and test edge cases](/app/guides/network-requests) without
  involving your server. You can stub network traffic however you like.
- **Consistent Results:** Our architecture doesn't use Selenium or WebDriver.
  Say hello to fast, consistent and reliable tests that are flake-free.
- **Cross Browser Testing:** Run tests within Firefox and Chrome-family browsers
  (including Edge and Electron) locally and
  [in a Continuous Integration pipeline](/app/guides/cross-browser-testing).

#### Cypress Cloud

- **Test Replay:** Record to [Cypress Cloud](/cloud/introduction) and replay the test exactly as it executed during the run for zero-configuration debugging using [Test Replay](/cloud/test-replay).
- **Smart Orchestration:** Once you're set up to record to Cypress Cloud, easily
  [parallelize](/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization) your test
  suite, rerun failed specs first with
  [Spec Prioritization](/cloud/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization),
  and cancel test runs on failures with
  [Auto Cancellation](/cloud/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation) for
  tight feedback loops.
- **Flake Detection:** Discover and diagnose unreliable tests with Cypress
  Cloud's [Flaky test management](/cloud/flaky-test-management).
- **Branch Review:** Quickly identify the impact a pull request might have on your test suite in a single view using [Branch Review](/cloud/branch-review). Compare which tests are failing, flaky, pending, added, or modified between the source and base branches and prevent the merging of low-quality code.
- **Integrations:** Integrate with [GitHub](/cloud/integrations/source-control/github), [GitLab](/cloud/integrations/source-control/gitlab), or [Bitbucket](/cloud/integrations/source-control/bitbucket) to see test results directly on every push or pull request. Cypress Cloud also integrates with
  [Slack](/cloud/integrations/slack), [Jira](/cloud/integrations/jira), and [Microsoft Teams](/cloud/integrations/teams) to keep your team in the loop.
- **Test Analytics:** Track test results over time with [Test Analytics](/cloud/analytics/overview) to identify trends, regressions, and improvements in your test suite. Use our [Data Extract API](/cloud/integrations/data-extract-api) to extract the data that is important to your team.

#### Add ons

- **Cypress Accessibility:** Ensure your application is accessible to all users
  with Cypress Accessibility.
- **Cypress UI Coverage:** Ensure you have tested every part of your application
  with Cypress UI Coverage.

## Solutions

Cypress can be used to ensure several different types of test. This can provide
even more confidence that your application under test is working as intended and accessible to all users.

### End-to-end

Cypress was originally designed to run end-to-end (E2E) tests on anything that
runs in a browser. A typical E2E test visits the application in a browser and
performs actions via the UI just like a real user would.

```js
it('adds todos', () => {
  cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io/')
  cy.get('[data-testid="new-todo"]')
    .type('write code{enter}')
    .type('write tests{enter}')
  // confirm the application is showing two items
  cy.get('[data-testid="todos"]').should('have.length', 2)
})
```

### Component

You can also use Cypress to mount components from supported web frameworks and
execute [component tests](/app/component-testing/overview).

```js
import TodoList from './components/TodoList'

it('contains the correct number of todos', () => {
  const todos = [
    { text: 'Buy milk', id: 1 },
    { text: 'Learn Component Testing', id: 2 },
  ]

  cy.mount(<TodoList todos={todos} />)
  // the component starts running like a mini web app
  cy.get('[data-testid="todos"]').should('have.length', todos.length)
})
```

### Accessibility

You can write Cypress tests to check the accessibility of your application.
When combined with Cypress Accessibility, insights can be surfaced when
accessibility standards are not met through your testing - with no configuration required.

```js
it('adds todos', () => {
  cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io/')
  //..
})
```

### API

Cypress can perform arbitrary HTTP calls, thus you can use it for API testing.

```js
it('adds a todo', () => {
  cy.request({
    url: '/todos',
    method: 'POST',
    body: {
      title: 'Write REST API',
    },
  })
    .its('body')
    .should('deep.contain', {
      title: 'Write REST API',
      completed: false,
    })
})
```

### Other

Finally, through a large number of [official and 3rd party plugins](/plugins)
you can write other types of tests.

## Get Started

### <Icon name="cog" /> Set up tests

There are no servers, drivers, or any other dependencies to install or
configure. You can quickly see your first passing test within minutes for
[End-to-end tests](/app/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test) or
[Component tests](/app/component-testing/getting-started).

### <Icon name="code" /> Write tests

Tests written in Cypress are meant to be easy to read and understand. Our [API](/api/table-of-contents)
comes fully baked, on top of tools you are familiar with already.

<DocsVideo src="/img/snippets/writing-tests.mp4" title="Writing Tests" />

### <Icon name="play-circle" /> Run tests

Cypress runs as fast as your browser can render content. You can watch tests run
in real time as you develop your applications and time travel to previous steps.

<DocsVideo src="/img/snippets/running-tests.mp4" title="Running Tests" />

### <Icon name="bug" /> Debug tests

Readable error messages help you to debug quickly. You also have access to all
the developer tools you know and love.

<DocsVideo src="/img/snippets/debugging.mp4" title="Debugging Tests" />

### <Icon name="bug" /> Integrate with CI

Cypress can be easily integrated into your CI provider.
We have guides for all the [popular CI providers](/app/continuous-integration/ci-provider-examples#Guides).
You can also use [Cypress GitHub Action](/app/continuous-integration/github-actions#Cypress-GitHub-Action) to run your tests.

<DocsVideo src="https://youtube.com/embed/USX6AntcPyg" />

### <Icon name="bug" /> Optimize your Test Suite

Cypress can run tests in parallel, and you can group test runs by browser or
device. You can also run tests in a headless mode to speed up your test suite.

<DocsImage

  alt="Parallelization Diagram"
/>

### <Icon name="bug" /> Replay Tests

With [Cypress Cloud](/cloud/introduction), you can record your tests, replay them exactly as they
executed during the run, and then debug using [Test Replay](/cloud/test-replay).

<DocsVideo
  title="Test Replay Product Demo"
  src="https://youtube.com/embed/vFLShoCM8pA"
/>

### <Icon name="bug" /> Integrate into your workflow

Cypress Cloud integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket to see test results
directly on every push or pull request. You can also integrate with Slack, Jira,
and Microsoft Teams to keep your team in the loop.

<DocsImage

  alt="Cypress Cloud Integrations"
/>

### <Icon name="bug" /> Analyze Testing Trends

Track test results over time with [Test Analytics](/cloud/analytics/overview) to
identify trends, regressions, and improvements in your test suite. Use our [Data
Extract API](/cloud/integrations/data-extract-api) to extract the data
that is important to your team.

## Cypress in the Real World

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/overview/v10/real-world-app.png"
  alt="Cypress Real World App"
/>

Cypress makes it quick and easy to start testing, and as you begin to test your
app, **you'll often wonder if you're using best practices or scalable
strategies**.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
To guide the way, the Cypress team has created the <Icon name="github" inline="true" contentType="rwa" />,
a full stack example application that demonstrates testing with **Cypress in practical and realistic
scenarios.**

The RWA achieves full [code-coverage](/app/tooling/code-coverage) with
end-to-end tests
[across multiple browsers](/app/guides/cross-browser-testing) and
[device sizes](/api/commands/viewport), but also includes
[visual regression tests](/app/tooling/visual-testing), API tests, unit
tests, and runs them all in an
[efficient CI pipeline](https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/7s5okt). Use the RWA
to **learn, experiment, tinker, and practice** web application testing with
Cypress.

The app is bundled with everything you need,
[just clone the repository](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app)
and start testing.
