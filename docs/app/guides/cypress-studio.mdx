# Cypress Studio AI

:::info

##### <Icon name="question-circle" color="#4BBFD2" /> What you'll learn

- How to generate Cypress tests by interacting with your app
- How AI automatically suggests relevant assertions as you record
- How to add assertions by right-clicking elements
- How to quickly extend or edit tests without leaving Cypress

:::

## Why Use Cypress Studio

Cypress Studio turns test creation into a natural part of exploring your app.  
Instead of manually typing every `.get()`, `.click()`, or `.type()` command, you can **record interactions in real time**, automatically generate Cypress code, and fine-tune your test inline.

### Powered by AI

With **Cypress Studio AI**, intelligent recommendations appear automatically as you record. The AI analyzes your interactions and suggests the most relevant assertions for each step, helping you build more comprehensive tests with less effort.

- **Save time**: Skip manually typing `.get().click().type()` sequences
- **Stay in the flow**: Build and extend tests without leaving the Cypress App
- **Boost coverage**: Add new checks to existing tests in seconds
- **AI-powered insights**: Get intelligent assertion recommendations as you interact with your app

## ðŸš€ Quickstart: Try Studio AI in 60 Seconds

:::success

1. **Enable Studio:**  
   Add to your `cypress.config.js` (Cypress Studio is currently experimental):

   ```js
   {
     e2e: {
       experimentalStudio: true
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Run a Spec:**
   Open Cypress, run a spec file, and click New Test or Edit in Studio.

3. **Interact & Get AI Recommendations:**
   Click, type, and watch as AI automatically suggests relevant assertions in the Studio Panel. Accept or reject recommendations as you build your test.

4. **Save Your Test:**
   Click Save to save your test with all the AI-suggested assertions.

## How Cypress Studio works

When Studio is enabled, you can:

- **Record:** Interact with your app in the Cypress browser to capture test commands
- **Assert:** Right-click any element to add built-in assertions
- **Edit:** Adjust tests inline without switching tools

Supported action commands include: [`.click()`](/api/commands/click), [`.type()`](/api/commands/type), [`.check()`](/api/commands/check), [`.uncheck()`](/api/commands/uncheck), [`.select()`](/api/commands/select)

## AI-Powered Recommendations

Cypress Studio AI enhances your test creation workflow by automatically analyzing your interactions and suggesting relevant assertions in real time. As you record actions, the AI appears in the Studio Panel with intelligent recommendations tailored to each step.

### How AI Recommendations Work

1. **Automatic Analysis**: As you interact with elements, the AI analyzes the context and element properties
2. **Smart Suggestions**: Relevant assertions appear in the Studio Panel based on your actions
3. **Accept or Reject**: Review each recommendation and choose to accept or reject it
4. **Seamless Integration**: Accepted recommendations can be saved to your test file

### Types of AI Recommendations

The AI Suggests assertions based on changes within your App after interactions occur.

- **Visibility checks**: Ensure elements are visible or hidden
- **Text validation**: Verify text content matches expectations
- **Form validation**: Check input values, selections, and form states
- **Element properties**: Validate attributes, classes, and other properties

### Start Studio

You can start Studio in several ways:

- Click **Edit in Studio** on a test in the Command Log.
- Click **New Test** on the running spec or suite.
- Click **Studio Beta** in the Studio panel.

### Record a new test

1. Click **New Test** on the file or suite you want to work in
2. Give your test a clear, descriptive name

Studio will automatically create a new test definition for you.

  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/create-new-test-in-suite-with-cypress-studio.mp4"
  autoPlay={true}
/>

### Extend an existing test

You can extend and update existing tests using Cypress Studio.

1. Run the spec in Cypress
2. Hover over the test in the Command Log
3. Click **Edit in Studio**

Studio runs your test up to the last command and lets you keep building from there.

  autoPlay={true}
/>

### Set a URL

Studio needs a `cy.visit()` before it can record. If your test doesn't have one yet, Studio will prompt you to enter a URL so it can start recording.

<DocsVideo
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/cy-visit-url-in-studio.mp4"
  autoPlay={true}
/>

### Record actions

Record actions by interacting with the application under test.

- **Clicks:** Click buttons, links, or interactive elements
- **Typing:** Enter text into inputs and text areas
- **Selections:** Use dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons

Studio translates your actions into Cypress commands in real time.

<DocsVideo
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/studio-recording-typing.mp4"
  autoPlay={true}
/>

### Add assertions

Right-click any element in your app to instantly add an assertion.

For example, confirm text is visible, a checkbox is checked, or an element has a specific CSS class. Assertions are added directly in your test code, ready to save and run.

Assertions available are dynamically generated based on the element you right-click.

## How selectors are chosen

Cypress automatically generates a **unique selector** for each element you interact with, using a priority strategy to ensure accuracy.

<DefaultSelectorPriority />

Want more control? Use the [`Cypress.ElementSelector`](/api/cypress-api/element-selector-api) API to customize selector priority for your project.

## Limitations

- Works only in E2E tests (Component Testing not yet supported)
- Cucumber tests are not yet supported
- Cannot record across [multiple
  origins](/app/guides/cross-origin-testing).
- Studio cannot load when running in open mode with `@cypress/grep`. You will see an error in this case. Remove any `--grep` flags from your command during `cypress open` to use Studio.
- See issues labeled with [`experiment: studio`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22experiment%3A%20studio%22) for other known issues.

:::note

**Studio without AI**: Cypress Studio can be used without AI features and does not require a Cloud account. You can still record interactions and manually add assertions by right-clicking elements.

**Studio with AI**: AI-powered recommendations require a Cypress Cloud account and provide intelligent assertion suggestions as you record.

## Authentication & usage

Because Cypress Studio AI uses AI under the hood, it needs to communicate securely with large language models to analyze your interactions and generate relevant assertion recommendations. Cypress Cloud helps manage those requests, apply organization-level controls, and track usage in a way that's non-invasive. We never use your interactions to train AI models, and you can turn AI features off at any time. Cypress Studio AI is currently available on any of our [Cypress Cloud plan types](https://www.cypress.io/pricing).

**To use Cypress Studio AI, you must either:**

- Log into Cypress Cloud
- Set up your project in Cypress Cloud

**If you don't have a Cloud account, create a free account and gain access to a 2-week trial of all paid features.**

## Pricing & usage limits

During the experimental release, access will be provided at no additional charge. Users are limited by the number of AI recommendations they can receive per hour. This limit is higher for paid accounts and lower for free accounts. Our intention is to not limit normal usage of the feature.

:::note

Please note that pricing and usage limitations are subject to future adjustments. We commit to keeping you informed of any such changes.

:::

### Usage limits

**User limits on projects with free accounts:**

- 60 AI recommendations per hour

**User limits on projects with paid accounts (or on free trial):**

- 300 AI recommendations per hour

## Privacy & security

For detailed information about how Cypress protects your data and manages AI model security, see our [Security & Compliance page](https://www.cypress.io/security).

## Disabling AI features

AI capabilities, including Cypress Studio AI, are enabled by default for all users on any Cloud plan. Organization admins and owners can enable and disable the AI capabilities for their entire organization from their organization settings. For more information, see [our FAQ](/cloud/faq#Are-all-Cloud-AI-capabilities-enabled-by-default-How-can-I-turn-them-off).

You can also disable Studio AI locally in the Cypress App by toggling off the AI feature in the Studio panel.
