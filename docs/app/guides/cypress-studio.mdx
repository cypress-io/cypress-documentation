# Cypress Studio

:::info

##### <Icon name="question-circle" color="#4BBFD2" /> What you'll learn

- How to generate Cypress tests by interacting with your app
- How to add assertions by right-clicking elements
- How to quickly extend or edit tests without leaving Cypress

:::

## Why Use Cypress Studio

Cypress Studio turns test creation into a natural part of exploring your app.  
Instead of manually typing every `.get()`, `.click()`, or `.type()` command, you can **record interactions in real time**, automatically generate Cypress code, and fine-tune your test inline.

- **Save time**: Skip manually typing `.get().click().type()` sequences
- **Stay in the flow**: Build and extend tests without leaving the Cypress App
- **Boost coverage**: Add new checks to existing tests in seconds

## ðŸš€ Quickstart: Try Studio in 60 Seconds

:::success

1. **Enable Studio:**  
   Add to your `cypress.config.js` (Cypress Studio is currently experimental):

   ```js
   {
     e2e: {
       experimentalStudio: true
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Run a Spec:**
   Open Cypress, run a spec file, and click New Test or Edit in Studio.

3. **Interact & Save:**
   Click, type, and right-click to add assertions. Click Save to save your test.

## How Cypress Studio works

When Studio is enabled, you can:

- **Record:** Interact with your app in the Cypress browser to capture test commands
- **Assert:** Right-click any element to add built-in assertions
- **Edit:** Adjust tests inline without switching tools

Supported action commands include: [`.click()`](/api/commands/click), [`.type()`](/api/commands/type), [`.check()`](/api/commands/check), [`.uncheck()`](/api/commands/uncheck), [`.select()`](/api/commands/select)

### Start Studio

You can start Studio in several ways:

- Click **Edit in Studio** on a test in the Command Log.
- Click **New Test** on the running spec or suite.
- Click **Studio Beta** in the Studio panel.

### Record a new test

1. Click **New Test** on the file or suite you want to work in
2. Give your test a clear, descriptive name

Studio will automatically create a new test definition for you.

  autoPlay={true}
/>

### Extend an existing test

You can extend and update existing tests using Cypress Studio.

1. Run the spec in Cypress
2. Hover over the test in the Command Log
3. Click **Edit in Studio**

Studio runs your test up to the last command and lets you keep building from there.

### Set a URL

Studio needs a `cy.visit()` before it can record. If your test doesn't have one yet, Studio will prompt you to enter a URL so it can start recording.

### Record actions

Record actions by interacting with the application under test.

- **Clicks:** Click buttons, links, or interactive elements
- **Typing:** Enter text into inputs and text areas
- **Selections:** Use dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons

Studio translates your actions into Cypress commands in real time.

### Add assertions

Right-click any element in your app to instantly add an assertion.

For example, confirm text is visible, a checkbox is checked, or an element has a specific CSS class. Assertions are added directly in your test code, ready to save and run.

Assertions available are dynamically generated based on the element you right-click.

## How selectors are chosen

Cypress automatically generates a **unique selector** for each element you interact with, using a priority strategy to ensure accuracy.

<DefaultSelectorPriority />

Want more control? Use the [`Cypress.ElementSelector`](/api/cypress-api/element-selector-api) API to customize selector priority for your project.

## Limitations

- Works only in E2E tests (Component Testing not yet supported)
- Cannot record across [multiple
  origins](/app/guides/cross-origin-testing).
- Studio cannot load when running in open mode with `@cypress/grep`. You will see an error in this case. Remove any `--grep` flags from your command during `cypress open` to use Studio.
- See issues labeled with [`experiment: studio`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22experiment%3A%20studio%22) for other known issues.

## Coming Soon: AI in Studio

Imagine Studio suggesting the most relevant assertions for every step you take. Cypress AI is a feature that's **coming soon** that will recommend relevant assertions in real time based on your interactions.
