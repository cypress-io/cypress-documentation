# Cypress Studio

- How to generate Cypress tests by interacting with your app
- How to add assertions through the browser UI
- How to extend or edit tests using Cypress Studio

:::


## Overview

Cypress Studio makes test creation faster and easier. With Studio, you can record user interactions in the browser and instantly generate Cypress test code. Add assertions with a rightclick and fine-tune your tests inline.

It is ideal for bootstrapping new tests or extending existing ones without writing every `.get()`, `.click()`, or `.type()` command by hand.

Cypress Studio is an experimental feature and can be enabled by adding the
[experimentalStudio](/app/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing)
attribute to your Cypress configuration.

```js
{
  e2e: {
    experimentalStudio: true
  }
}

## How Cypress Studio works

When Studio is enabled, you can:

- Generate test steps by interacting with your app in the Cypress browser
- Add assertions by right-clicking DOM elements
- Save or edit tests without leaving Cypress

Supported action commands include: [`.click()`](/api/commands/click), [`.type()`](/api/commands/type), [`.check()`](/api/commands/check), [`.uncheck()`](/api/commands/uncheck), [`.select()`](/api/commands/select)

Click the Studio panel button in the top right of the Cypress browser to open the Studio panel. You can also open the Studio panel by clicking **Edit in Studio** or **New test** in the Command Log.

## Recording new tests

You can record a new test with Cypress Studio inside any describe or context block.

1. Click **New Test** under the desired block
2. Add a name for the test
3. Enter the URL of the page you want to test (if not on the current page)
4. Interact with your app (click, type, select elements)
5. Right-click elements to add assertions
6. Click **Save** to save the changes to your spec file

## Extending existing tests

You can also extend and update existing tests using Cypress Studio.

1. Run the spec in Cypress
2. Hover over the test in the Command Log
3. Click **Edit in Studio** to open Cypress Studio
4. Interact with your app to record actions
5. Right-click to add assertions
6. Click **Save** to save the changes to your spec file

The selectors are generated according to the
[`Cypress.ElementSelector` selector priority](/api/cypress-api/selector-playground-api#Default-Selector-Priority).


## Limitations

- Cypress Studio is currently only available for writing E2E tests, and doesn't
  yet work with Component Testing.
- Cypress Studio does not support writing tests that use domains of [multiple
  origins](/app/guides/cross-origin-testing).
- Cypress Studio can not interact with elements within a ShadowDom directly, though it can still run tests that do.
