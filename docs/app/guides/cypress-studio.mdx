<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" /> **Experimental**

Cypress Studio is an experimental feature and can be enabled by adding the
[experimentalStudio](/app/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing)
attribute to your Cypress configuration.

:::

:::cypress-config-example

```js
{
  e2e: {
    experimentalStudio: true
  }
}
```

## Limitations

- Cypress Studio is currently only available for writing E2E tests, and doesn't
  yet work with Component Testing.
- Cypress Studio does not support writing tests that use domains of [multiple
  origins](/app/guides/cross-origin-testing).

## Overview

Cypress Studio provides a visual way to generate tests within Cypress, by
_recording interactions_ against the application under test.

The [`.click()`](/api/commands/click), [`.type()`](/api/commands/type),
[`.check()`](/api/commands/check), [`.uncheck()`](/api/commands/uncheck), and
[`.select()`](/api/commands/select) Cypress commands are supported and will
generate test code when interacting with the DOM inside of the Cypress Studio.

You can also generate assertions by right clicking on an element that you would
like to assert on.

The Cypress <Icon name="github" />
[Real World App (RWA)](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app) is
an open source project implementing a payment application to demonstrate
real-world usage of Cypress testing methods, patterns, and workflows. It will be
used to demonstrate the functionality of Cypress Studio below.

### Extending a Test

You can extend any preexisting test or start by creating a new test with the
following test scaffolding.

:::info

Clone the <Icon name="github" inline="true" contentType="rwa" /> and refer to
the
[cypress/tests/demo/cypress-studio.cy.ts](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/blob/develop/cypress/tests/demo/cypress-studio.spec.ts)
file.

:::

```js
// Code from Real World App (RWA)
describe('Cypress Studio Demo', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Seed database with test data
    cy.task('db:seed')

    // Login test user
    cy.database('find', 'users').then((user) => {
      cy.login(user.username, 's3cret', true)
    })
  })

  it('create new transaction', () => {
    // Extend test with Cypress Studio
  })
})
```



#### Step 1 - Run the spec

We 'll use Cypress Studio to perform a "New Transaction" user journey. First,
launch Cypress and select **End To End testing**, then choose a browser to run specs
in.

Once the browser is open, run the spec created in the previous step.

<DocsImage src="/img/app/cypress-studio/run-spec-1.png" alt="Cypress Studio" />

#### Step 2 - Launch Cypress Studio

Once the tests complete their run, hover over a test in the [Command Log](/app/core-concepts/open-mode#Command-Log) to
reveal an **Add Commands to Test** button.

Clicking on **Add Commands to Test** will launch the Cypress Studio.

:::info

Cypress will automatically execute all hooks and currently present test code,
and then the test can be extended from that point on (e.g. We are logged into
the application inside the `beforeEach` block).

:::

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/extend-activate-studio.png"
  alt="Activate Cypress Studio"
/>



Next, Cypress will execute the test in isolation and pause after the last
command in the test.

Now, we can begin updating the test to create a new transaction between users.


<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/extend-ready.png"
  alt="Cypress Studio Ready"
/>

#### Step 3 - Interact with the Application

To record actions, begin interacting with the application. Here we will click on
the **New** button on the right side of the header and as a result we will see our
click recorded in the Command Log.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/extend-click-new-transaction.png"
  alt="Cypress Studio Recording Click"
/>

Next, we can start typing in the name of a user that we want to pay.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/extend-type-user-name.png"
  alt="Cypress Studio Recording Type"
/>

Once we see the name come up in the results, we want to add an assertion to
ensure that our search function works correctly. **Right click** on the user's
name to bring up a menu from which we can add an assertion to check that the
element contains the correct text (the user's name).

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/extend-assert-user-name.png"
  alt="Cypress Studio Add Assertion"
/>

We can then click on that user in order to progress to the next screen. We'll
complete the transaction form by clicking on and typing in the amount and
description inputs.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/extend-type-transaction-form.png"
  alt="Cypress Studio Recording Type"
/>

Now it's time to complete the transaction. You might have noticed that the "Pay"
button was disabled before we typed into the inputs. To make sure that our form
validation works properly, let's add an assertion to make sure the "Pay" button
is enabled.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/extend-assert-button-enabled.png"
  alt="Cypress Studio Add Assertion"
/>

Finally, we will click the "Pay" button and get presented with a confirmation
page of our new transaction.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/extend-save-test.png"
  alt="Cypress Studio Save Commands"
/>

To discard the interactions, click the **Cancel** button to exit Cypress Studio.
If satisfied with the interactions with the application, click **Save Commands**
and the test code will be saved to your spec file. Alternatively you can choose
the **copy** button in order to copy the generated commands to your clipboard.

#### Generated Test Code

Viewing our test code, we can see that the test is updated after clicking **Save
Commands** with the actions we recorded in Cypress Studio.

```js
// Code from Real World App (RWA)
describe('Cypress Studio Demo', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Seed database with test data
    cy.task('db:seed')

    // Login test user
    cy.database('find', 'users').then((user) => {
      cy.login(user.username, 's3cret', true)
    })
  })

  it('create new transaction', () => {
    /* ==== Generated with Cypress Studio ==== */
    cy.get('[data-test=nav-top-new-transaction]').click()
    cy.get('[data-test=user-list-search-input]').clear()
    cy.get('[data-test=user-list-search-input]').type('dev')
    cy.get(
      '[data-test=user-list-item-tsHF6_D5oQ] > .MuiListItemText-root > .MuiListItemText-primary'
    ).should('have.text', 'Devon Becker')
    cy.get('[data-test=user-list-item-tsHF6_D5oQ]').click()
    cy.get('#amount').clear()
    cy.get('#amount').type('$25')
    cy.get('#transaction-create-description-input').clear()
    cy.get('#transaction-create-description-input').type('Sushi dinner')
    cy.get('[data-test=transaction-create-submit-payment]').should('be.enabled')
    cy.get('[data-test=transaction-create-submit-payment]').click()
    /* ==== End Cypress Studio ==== */
  })
})
```

The selectors are generated according to the
[`Cypress.SelectorPlayground` selector priority](/api/cypress-api/selector-playground-api#Default-Selector-Priority).

### Adding a New Test

You can add a new test to any existing `describe` or `context` block, by
clicking **Add New Test** on our defined `describe` block.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/add-test-1.png"
  alt="Cypress Studio Add Test"
/>

We are launched into Cypress Studio and can begin interacting with our
application to generate the test.

For this test, we will add a new bank account. Our interactions are as follows:

1. Click "Bank Accounts" in left hand navigation
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/app/cypress-studio/add-test-2.png"
     alt="Cypress Studio Begin Add Test"
   />
2. Click the "Create" button on Bank Accounts page
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/app/cypress-studio/add-test-create.png"
     alt="Cypress Studio Add Test Create Bank Account"
   />
3. Fill out the bank account information
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/app/cypress-studio/add-test-form-complete.png"
     alt="Cypress Studio Add Test Complete Bank Account Form"
   />
4. Click the "Save" button
   <DocsImage
     src="/img/app/cypress-studio/add-test-form-save.png"
     alt="Cypress Studio Add Test Save Bank Account"
   />

To discard the interactions, click the **Cancel** button to exit Cypress Studio.

If satisfied with the interactions with the application, click **Save Commands**
and prompt will ask for the name of the test. Click **Save Test** and the test
will be saved to the file.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/add-test-save-test.png"
  alt="Cypress Studio Add Test Completed Run"
/>

Once saved, the file will be run again in Cypress.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/app/cypress-studio/add-test-final.png"
  alt="Cypress Studio Add Test Completed Run"
/>

Finally, viewing our test code, we can see that the test is updated after
clicking **Save Commands** with the actions we recorded in Cypress Studio.

```js
// Code from Real World App (RWA)
import { User } from 'models'

describe('Cypress Studio Demo', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.task('db:seed')

    cy.database('find', 'users').then((user: User) => {
      cy.login(user.username, 's3cret', true)
    })
  })

  it('create new transaction', () => {
    // Extend test with Cypress Studio
  })

  /* === Test Created with Cypress Studio === */
  it('create bank account', function () {
    /* ==== Generated with Cypress Studio ==== */
    cy.get('[data-test=sidenav-bankaccounts]').click()
    cy.get('[data-test=bankaccount-new] > .MuiButton-label').click()
    cy.get('#bankaccount-bankName-input').click()
    cy.get('#bankaccount-bankName-input').type('Test Bank Account')
    cy.get('#bankaccount-routingNumber-input').click()
    cy.get('#bankaccount-routingNumber-input').type('987654321')
    cy.get('#bankaccount-accountNumber-input').click()
    cy.get('#bankaccount-accountNumber-input').type('123456789')
    cy.get('[data-test=bankaccount-submit] > .MuiButton-label').click()
    /* ==== End Cypress Studio ==== */
  })
})
```
