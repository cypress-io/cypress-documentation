# Installing Cypress

First, make sure you meet the [system requirements](#System-requirements) including
[operating system](#Operating-System),
installation of [Node.js](#Nodejs) and
a supported [package manager](#Package-Manager).

## Install

Install Cypress via your preferred [package manager](#Package-Manager).
This will install Cypress locally as a dev dependency for your project.

<CypressInstallCommands />

Before installing Cypress, ensure you have a `package.json` file in the root of your project.
If you need to create the file,
you can run the `init` command for your [package manager](#Package-Manager).

System [proxy properties](/app/references/proxy-configuration) `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` are respected
for the download of the Cypress binary.
You can also use the npm properties
`npm_config_proxy` and `npm_config_https_proxy`.
Those have lower priority, so
they will only be used if the system properties are being resolved to not use a proxy.

### <Icon name="download" /> Direct download

The recommended approach is to install Cypress with `npm` because:

- Cypress is versioned like any other dependency.
- It simplifies running Cypress in
  [Continuous Integration](/app/continuous-integration/overview).

If you're not using Node or a package manager in your project or you want to just try Cypress out
quickly, you can always
[download Cypress directly from our CDN](https://download.cypress.io/desktop).

:::caution

Recording runs to Cypress Cloud is not possible from the direct download. This
download is only intended as a quick way to try out Cypress. To record tests to
Cypress Cloud, you'll need to install Cypress as an package dependency.

:::

The direct download will always grab the latest available version. Your platform
will be detected automatically.

Then you can manually unzip and double click. Cypress will run without needing
to install any dependencies.

:::info

<strong>Direct downloading for old versions</strong>

It is possible to download an old version from our CDN by suffixing the URL with
the desired version (ex.
[https://download.cypress.io/desktop/12.17.4](https://download.cypress.io/desktop/12.17.4)).

### <Icon name="cog" /> Advanced Installation

If you have more complex requirements, want to level-up your Cypress workflow or
just need help with troubleshooting, check out our
[Advanced Installation](/app/references/advanced-installation) reference.
You can also find instructions to [uninstall Cypress](/app/references/advanced-installation#Uninstall-Cypress) in this reference documentation.

### <Icon name="sync-alt" /> Continuous integration

Please read our
[Continuous Integration](/app/continuous-integration/overview) docs for
help installing Cypress in CI. When running in Linux you may need to install some
[system dependencies](#Linux-Prerequisites)
or you can use our [Docker images](#Docker-Prerequisites) which have everything you
need prebuilt.

## System requirements

### Operating System

Cypress supports running under these operating systems:

- **macOS** 11 and above _(Intel or Apple Silicon 64-bit (x64 or arm64))_
- **Linux** Ubuntu 20.04 and above, Fedora 40 and above, and Debian 11 and above _(x64 or arm64)_
  (see [Linux Prerequisites](#Linux-Prerequisites) down below)
- **Windows** 10 and above _(x64)_
- **Windows Server** 2019, 2022 and 2025 _(x64)_

### Node.js

Cypress requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) in order to install. We support the versions listed below:

- **Node.js** 18.x, 20.x, 22.x and above

Cypress generally aligns with
[Node's release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release).

#### Installing Node.js

Follow the instructions on [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

:::tip

<strong>Best Practice</strong>

Use a Node.js version manager as suggested on [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js,
or use an alternate Node.js version manager of your choice.
This allows you to switch between different versions of Node.js easily.

Note that the [Node.js Snap for Linux](https://github.com/nodejs/snap) version manager is not recommended for use with Cypress.
Attempting to use it as a non-root user may result in permissions errors.

:::

If you are using a [Cypress Docker image](../continuous-integration/overview#Cypress-Docker-variants),
you will find a fixed version of Node.js is pre-installed in the image.
You select the Node.js version using the Docker image tag.

### Package Manager

Cypress is [installed](#Install) using one of the following supported package managers:

| Package Manager                                  | Version             | Installation instructions                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)                   | `8.6.0` and above   | [Downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) |
| [Yarn 1 (Classic)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) | `1.22.22` and above | [Yarn 1 (Classic) Installation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)                                    |
| [Yarn (Modern aka berry)](https://yarnpkg.com/)  | `4.x` and above     | [Yarn Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)                                                |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)                         | `8.x` and above     | [pnpm Installation](https://pnpm.io/installation)                                                               |

#### Yarn Configuration

[Yarn (Modern)](https://yarnpkg.com/) configuration using [nodeLinker: "node-modules"](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#nodeLinker)
is preferred. Cypress [Component Testing](/app/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-Component-Testing) is not currently compatible with the default setting [nodeLinker: "pnp"](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#nodeLinker) which uses [Yarn Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp).

#### pnpm Configuration

The following configuration options enable Cypress to execute its `postinstall` script so it can install the Cypress binary into the [binary cache](/app/references/advanced-installation#Binary-cache).
If these configuration options are not set, then Cypress may skip the `postinstall` script execution and Cypress will not run.

The pnpm [side effects cache](https://pnpm.io/settings#sideeffectscache) uses and caches the results of (pre/post)install hooks and is not compatible with Cypress' own caching.
Disable the pnpm [side effects cache](https://pnpm.io/settings#sideeffectscache), for example using the following command, executed in the root of your Cypress project:

```shell
pnpm config set side-effects-cache false --location project
```

[pnpm@10.0.0](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.0.0) and above require allowlisting `cypress`.
Refer to the [pnpm settings](https://pnpm.io/settings) documentation for additional information.
In [pnpm@10.4.0](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.4.0) and above, the CLI `add` option [--allow-build](https://pnpm.io/cli/add#--allow-build) can be used, for example:

```shell
pnpm --allow-build cypress add --save-dev cypress
```

### Hardware

When running Cypress locally, it should run comfortably on any machine that is
capable of modern web development.

When running Cypress in CI, however, some of the lower-tier configurations might
not be able to run Cypress reliably, especially when recording videos or doing
longer test runs.

Some issues you might run into in CI that could be a sign of insufficient
resources are:

- Exiting early during `cypress run` or abruptly closing (“crashing”)
- Frozen or missing frames in the video that is captured
- Increased runtime

When running Cypress in CI, we recommend that you have the following hardware
requirements:

#### CPU

- 2 CPUs minimum to run Cypress
- 1 additional CPU if video recording is enabled
- 1 additional CPU per process you run outside of Cypress, such as:
  - App server (frontend)
  - App server (backend)
  - App database
  - Any additional infrastructure (Redis, Kafka, etc..)

### Memory

- 4GB minimum, 8GB+ for longer test runs

### Linux Prerequisites

If you're using Linux, you'll want to have the required dependencies installed
on your system. Depending on your system defaults, these dependencies may already be installed.
If not, run the command line for your operating system listed below.
See below under [Docker Prerequisites](#Docker-Prerequisites) for information on [Cypress Docker images](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images). These already include the necessary dependencies.

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```shell
apt-get install libgtk2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm-dev libnotify-dev libnss3 libxss1 libasound2 libxtst6 xauth xvfb
```

For Ubuntu 24.04, and above, use the following command:

```shell
apt-get install libgtk2.0-0t64 libgtk-3-0t64 libgbm-dev libnotify-dev libnss3 libxss1 libasound2t64 libxtst6 xauth xvfb
```

#### Arch

```shell
pacman -S gtk2 gtk3 alsa-lib xorg-server-xvfb libxss nss libnotify
```

#### Amazon Linux 2023

```shell
dnf install -y xorg-x11-server-Xvfb gtk3-devel nss alsa-lib
```

### Docker Prerequisites

[Cypress Docker images](../continuous-integration/overview#Cypress-Docker-variants) are available from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/cypress) and the
[Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/cypress-io).
These images, which are Linux (Debian) based, include all of the required dependencies pre-installed.

If you need Node.js, browser or Cypress version combinations which are not covered by the published Cypress Docker images,
then the [cypress/factory](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/tree/master/factory) image
allows you to generate your own customized Docker image easily.

If you are not using a Cypress Docker image, make sure that your base operating system is a Linux system listed in the supported
[Operating Systems](#Operating-System) above and that Node.js is installed in the image.
It is recommended to have `unzip` installed. This avoids the Cypress binary installation falling back to a slower unzip method using Node.js.
