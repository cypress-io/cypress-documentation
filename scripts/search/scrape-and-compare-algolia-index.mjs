/**
 * There is a chance that the scraper, for whatever reason, could
 * either over-index or under-index our documentation site. This has
 * happened before, so we want to know when it does happen. Algolia's
 * hosted scraper service has a built-in protection of some sort to detect
 * sudden dips or spikes in entries submitted to a specific index.
 * Since we are using our own scraper, we do not have that luxury.
 * This script will count the entries for the given index, execute the
 * scraper, then count the entries for the same index. The number of entries
 * should not change much after the scraper has completed. The acceptable
 * delta between the two numbers is purely arbitrary and may require fine tuning.
 * If the delta ever exceeds the acceptable delta, this script will exit with an
 * error code, causing CircleCI to fail the workflow and send a notification
 * to us. If significant changes were to occur to the documentation site
 * (large additions/removals of pages), it is possible that this script
 * will alert with a false negative.
 *
 * This script will *NOT* prevent a corrupted index from being uploaded
 * and/or prevent the scraper from over/under indexing the documentation site.
 * This script's purpose is to ALERT us when this does happen.
