## Writing Documentation

### Links

Links are all handled through our [cypress.on](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-on) api.

Link all pages but their name (property key) in `source/_data/sidebar.yml`

- https://on.cypress.io/NAME_OF_PAGE
- https://on.cypress.io/and
- https://on.cypress.io/visit
- https://on.cypress.io/unit-testing-recipe
- https://on.cypress.io/introduction-to-cypress
- https://on.cypress.io/writing-your-first-test
- https://on.cypress.io/general-questions-faq

### Adding Examples

The documents outlining examples are within the [`source/examples`](/source/examples) directory. Each document is written in markdown with a little bit of [Hexo flair](https://hexo.io/docs/tag-plugins.html). To add an example to a document, just try to follow the formatting of any previous examples in the markdown file.

Add an associating image with the example within the [`source/img/examples`](/source/img/examples) directory. Each image should be resolution **715w x 480h**. Reference the image in the markdown document as follows:

```md
{% img /img/examples/name-of-file.jpg "alt text describing img" %}
```

## Commiting Code

### Linting

Danger ðŸ“›: because we are minifying client side code using Hexo plugin which in turn calls
`uglify`, the code should be strictly ES5. Thus everything inside the `theme` should
be linted with ES5 settings and not upgraded to ES6.

### Push code to your repository

You should push your local changes to your forked GitHub repository and then
open a pull request from your repo to `cypress-io/cypress-documentation` repo.

### Pull Requests

- The pull request should be from your repository to branch `develop` in `cypress-io/cypress-documentation`
- When opening a PR for a specific issue already open, please use the `address #[issue number]` or `closes #[issue number]` syntax in the pull request description.

## Deployment

We will try to review and merge pull requests quickly. After merging we
will try releasing the documentation. First we will deploy it to staging environment,
run E2E tests (using Cypress itself of course), and then we will merge it into
`master`, which will deploy it to the official [https://docs.cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io)
website. If you want to know our deploy process, read [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)
