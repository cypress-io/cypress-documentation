# Translations
# By default we ignore each translation folder like "source/ja",
# During the build, We copy English file for each untranslated page to
# the language folder - if there is no fully translated file there.
# Thus when you add a new translation, add it to the source control
# with "git add --force" command to override the folder.

source/ja
source/zh-cn
source/pt-br
