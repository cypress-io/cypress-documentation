## 0.13.6

_Released 01/09/2016_

**Features:**

- All commands now retry if the associated element is disabled until the element
  is no longer disabled. If the command times out a specific error message is
  now thrown.
- [`cy.server()`](/api/commands/server) and [`cy.route()`](/api/commands/route)
  now take an optional `onAbort` callback which fires anytime an XHR is aborted.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed edge case where XHR's which were already aborted were aborted a 2nd time
  when tests end. Cypress now only aborts currently running XHR's which have not
  already been aborted.
- When passing an array of aliases to [`cy.wait()`](/api/commands/wait) there
  was an edge case where an incorrect error message was being thrown. The
  incorrect values were a combination of the wrong alias, the wrong timeout
  value, or the wrong request or response. Now Cypress correctly provides all 3
  of these values.
