## 0.13.3

_Released 12/25/2015_

**Notes:**

- Merry Christmas everyone ;-)

**Features:**

- Overhauled the entire subsystem dealing with an element's visibility state.
  Previously we were using jQuery's `.is(":visible")` selector which was
  ineffective at truly determining when an element is "visible". Our changes now
  differ significantly from jQuery, but they match what a real user would
  consider visible, and the rules are fairly easy to explain. In other words
  these rules should just "make sense".
- An element is considered visible if it can be "interactive" with a user. In
  other words, if the user is able to click, type, drag, or otherwise physically
  interact with the element it is considered visible.
- Because of the additional complexities of how Cypress considers an element
  `visible`, we now have added the **exact** reason why an element is not
  visible when throwing an error. This means you'll see errors detailing whether
  an element or its parents have `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, or
  whether an element is considered hidden because its effective `width` or
  `height` is zero. Whatever the reason, Cypress will indicate why your element
  is considered hidden.
- Exposed `Cypress.Dom.isHidden` which holds the logic for determining an
  element's visibility. Modify this to change the rules.
- Upgraded [`.select()`](/api/commands/select) to automatically retry when the
  `<select>` is disabled, its matching `<option>` is disabled, or when Cypress
  cannot find a matching `<option>`. This more correctly aligns with the
  behavior of other actions like [`.click()`](/api/commands/click), which
  automatically retry until the element is ready to receive the action.

**Bugfixes:**

- Throw on [`.select()`](/api/commands/select) when it cannot find a matching
  `<option>`. Also throw when `<select>` or a matching `<option>` is disabled.
  Fixes [#91](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/91).
- "Hidden" elements which actually displace height or width are now highlighted
  when restoring the DOM when a command is hovered.
- Margin on zero client width / client height is now displayed correctly on
  command hover and more accurately mimics the way Chrome Dev Tools highlights
  elements.
- Using `history.back`, `history.forward`, or `history.go` in CI or in headless
  mode now works again.

**Misc:**

- The updated hidden rules apply to all assertions like `should("be.hidden")`,
  and how Cypress indicates an element is hidden displays in the Command Log.
- Updated many error messages to be more explanatory and precise.
- Elements which are stringified during errors now indicate their text content
  (truncated to 10 characters) `<button>Save</button>` or whether they contain
  children elements by indicating an ellipsis `<div>...</div>`.
- The [Routes instrument panel](/api/commands/route) now displays the column:
  `Stubbed` instead of `Status`, which indicates whether a route is stubbing
  matching XHR's.
