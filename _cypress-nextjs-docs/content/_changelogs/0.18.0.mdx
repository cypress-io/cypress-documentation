## 0.18.0

_Released 11/27/2016_

**Notes:**

- We've created a new
  [example recipes repo](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes)
  to show you common testing scenarios including how to use the new module
  support.

**Summary:**

- We've added automatic ES2015+, module, JSX, and CJSX support to all test
  files. This means you can use `require`, `import`, or `export` declarations to
  load other files. You can also use this to import your own application
  specific JavaScript modules and write unit tests for them. More of these
  details are yet to come.
  [See this issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/318).
- You can now use your regularly installed `node_modules` in your project to do
  things like utilizing [`lodash`](https://lodash.com/) for utility functions or
  extending [`chai`](http://www.chaijs.com/) with assertion plugins.
- Because we're now processing the spec files prior to handing them off to the
  browser, this means we will display problems like syntax errors when something
  in the processing goes wrong. Additionally, we print these out during
  `cypress run`, so you're not stuck wondering what went wrong.

**Breaking Changes:**

- Previously, we auto-magically included all files within
  [`cypress/support`](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Folder-Structure).
  This has now [gone away](/guides/references/error-messages) and we've
  simplified this to automatically including a single `cypress/support/index.js`
  file. That single file acts as the entry point meaning you should `import` or
  `require` the other support files you'd like to include. Although this is
  still "automatic" it's much less magical and we'll be updating all of our docs
  to reflect this. The purpose of `cypress/support` hasn't really changed, just
  the implementation of it has. We will automatically seed a
  `cypress/support/index.js` file for you (even on existing projects). The file
  location of `cypress/support/index.js` can be changed with the new
  [`supportFile`](/guides/references/configuration#Folders-Files) option in your
  `cypress.json`. This feature can also be turned off by specifying
  `supportFile: false`.

**Features:**

- We now support ES2015+, modules, and JSX in all spec files. Fixes
  [#246](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/246).
- Spec files may now be written as `.js`, `.jsx`, `.coffee`, or `cjsx` files.
- Test files with JS syntax errors are now
  [handled](/guides/references/error-messages) and we provide a GUI that points
  to the exact line/column number. Additionally we print these out during
  `cypress run` and exit the process with `code 1`. Fixes
  [#293](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/293).

**Misc:**

- We improved the logic around when and if we scaffold files on a new project.
  We're much smarter about this and not generating these forcibly every time.
  Fixes [#285](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/285).
- Simplified handling of support files and made them less "magical". Fixes
  [#286](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/286).
- Renamed `supportFolder` to
  [`supportFile`](/guides/references/configuration#Folders-Files) in
  `cypress.json`. We will automatically rename your `cypress.json` if this
  property was present on update.
