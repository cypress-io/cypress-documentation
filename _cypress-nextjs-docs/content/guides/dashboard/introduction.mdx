The [Cypress Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) is a service that gives
you access to recorded test results - typically when running Cypress tests from
your [CI provider](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction). The Dashboard
provides you insight into what happened when your tests ran.

The Cypress
[Real World App (RWA)](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app)
leverages the
[Cypress Dashboard in CI](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/7s5okt) to test
over 300 test cases in parallel across 25 machines, multiple browsers, multiple
device sizes, and multiple operating systems.
