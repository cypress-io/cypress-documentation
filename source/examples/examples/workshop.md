We have put together contents for a full day workshop that teaches how to test a modern web application using Cypress. You can preview the slides here: {% url https://gitpitch.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress#/ https://gitpitch.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress#/ %}

The repository {% url "cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress" https://github.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress %} has an example application, test exercises (with answers), and speaker slides with notes. The content should be a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn Cypress or teach it to others. The exercises cover the following topics (see the workshop's {% url "README file" https://github.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress#readme %} for an exact list).

- How to install and run Cypress
- Writing and running a basic test
- Setting up video recording and screenshots
- Using the Selector Playground
- Testing XHR requests
- Using data fixtures to mock data
- Running tests on CI and recording to the Dashboard
- Customizing your own reporters
- Writing custom Cypress commands
- Debugging in Cypress
- Component testing

We hope this testing workshop proves itself useful in teaching developers and testers good Cypress practices.
