To send the data and results of your tests to the [Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard-introduction), Cypress needs free access to some URLs.

If you are running the tests from within a restrictive VPN you will need to add some URLs to your whitelist so that Cypress can have effective communication with the Dashboard.

**The URLs are the following:**

- `https://api.cypress.io` - **Cypress API**
- `https://assets.cypress.io` - **Asset CDN** (Org logos, icons, videos, screenshots, etc.)
- `https://authenticate.cypress.io` - **Authentication API**
- `https://dashboard.cypress.io` - **Dashboard app**
- `https://docs.cypress.io` - **Cypress documentation**
- `https://download.cypress.io` - **CDN download of Cypress binary**
- `https://on.cypress.io` - **URL shortener for link redirects**
