{% note warning %}
Please be aware that Cypress only currently supports intercepting XMLHttpRequests. Requests using the Fetch API and other types of network requests like page loads and `<script>` tags will not be intercepted or visible in the Command Log. See {% issue 95 %} for more details and temporary workarounds.
