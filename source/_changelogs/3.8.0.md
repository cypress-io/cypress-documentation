- The commands {% url "`.its()`" its %} and {% url "`.invoke()`" invoke %} now accept an `options` object to allow changing logging options. Addresses {% issue 1450 %}.

- Upgraded Electron to 7.1.4. This bumps the internal Node version to 12.8.1 and the internal Chromium version to 78.0.3904.113.

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where a supplied `Cookie` header during {% url "`cy.visit()`" visit %} or {% url "`cy.request()`" request %} would be overwritten by the `Cookie` header generated from the browser's cookie store. Fixes {% issue 5894 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %}  where {% url "`cy.getCookie()`" getcookie %} would incorrectly filter cookies by their domain, leading to unexpected results. Fixes {% issue 5656 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where calling `.type({ force: true })` on hidden inputs would not type the correct characters. Fixes {% issue 5835 %}.
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where {% url "`.type()`" type %} was not respecting previous selections if the current value of the input was the same as the key. This also fixed an where {% url "`.type()`" type %} would not respect previous selections in non-selectionRange inputs (like email or number inputs). Fixes {% issue 5703 %}.
- During visibility checks, Cypress now properly evaluates a DOM element transformed by `scale(0)` or `rotateY(90deg)` as not visible. Fixes {% issue 723 %}.
- Fixed a bug where the specs list in interactive mode would not refresh when files are changed on disk. Fixes {% issue 5933 %}.
