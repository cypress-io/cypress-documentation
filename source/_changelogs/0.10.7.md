# 0.10.7

*Released 08/16/2015*

**Features:**

- Port can now be specified as a CLI argument and will override any values stored in `cypress.json`.

**Misc:**

- When running through the CLI, Cypress will now display an error if the server's port is currently in use. Previously this would not output an rror and the process would just hang.
