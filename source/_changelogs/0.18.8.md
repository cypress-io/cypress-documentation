# 0.18.8

*Released 02/05/2017*

**Overview:**

- We have officially implemented our [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/) integration: adding {% url `cy.stub()` stub %}, {% url `cy.spy()` spy %}, {% url `cy.clock()` clock %}, and {% url `cy.tick()` tick %}. We've matched Sinon's APIs and added `sinon-as-promised` and `chai-sinon`. In addition we've fixed Sinon performance issues, and improved the display of assertion passes and failures.
- These new APIs will work well in both `unit` tests and `integration` tests.

**Features:**

- You can now use {% url `cy.stub()` stub %} and {% url `cy.spy()` spy %} synchronously. These both match the Sinon API identically. We will display `stub/spy` calls in the Command Log and provide the call count, arguments, context, and return values when you click on the log. Stubs are automatically reset between tests.  Fixes {% issue 377 '#377' %}.
- We've added our own special aliasing flavor to {% url `cy.stub()` stub %} and {% url `cy.spy()` spy %}. You can use the {% url `.as()` as %} command and we will associate spy and stub invocations (the same way we do with XHR aliasing and route matching).
- We've added {% url `cy.clock()` clock %} and {% url `cy.tick()` tick %} which are both asynchronous methods to modify timers in your application under test. We automatically apply clock (even if you invoke it before your first {% url `cy.visit()` visit %}) and will automatically reapply it after page load. {% url `cy.tick()` tick %} will enable you to control the amount of time you want passed in your application. This is great for controlling *throttled* or *debounced* functions.
- `sinon-as-promised` is automatically applied under the hood which extends Sinon and provides the `.resolves(...)` and `.rejects(...)` APIs which makes it easy to stub promise returning functions.
- We support and display multiple sub spies when using Sinon's `.withArgs(...)` function.

**Misc:**

- We've enhanced `chai-sinon` by improving the output during passes or failures. Fixes {% issue 31 '#31' %}.
- We've ripped out Sinon's argument serialization in favor of our own.
- We no longer send Sinon to the remote application under test. In other words, you'll no longer see `sinon.js` being sent as a network request.
- Deprecated the undocumented `cy.agents` function, but it will continue to work and will be officially removed later.
