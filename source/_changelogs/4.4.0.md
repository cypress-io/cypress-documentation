*Released 4/13/2020*

**Features:**

- {% url "TypeScript" typescript-support %} test files are now supported without using special preprocessors plugins. Addresses {% issue 1859 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed an issue where Cypress could crash with a `This socket has been ended by the other party` error when testing applications that make use of WebSockets. Fixes {% issue 6458 %}.
- Uncaught errors thrown from within application or test code now display their proper stack trace. Fixes {% issue 6964 %}.
- Assertion errors now include a stack trace that includes the calling code. Fixes {% issue 6969 %}.
- We now clone the `options` object passed into Cypress commands so that they're not mutated and receive the proper `options`. Fixes {% issue 3171 %}.
