# 0.9.0

*Released 07/02/2015*

**Summary:**

- {% url `cy.viewport()` viewport %} is a new command which will resize the viewport to a specified width and height. There is ow a default `viewport` size of `1000x660`.

**Features:**

- Your application's viewport dimensions will now automatically scale to fit regardless of your screen's size. This enables you to test resolutions larger than what your screen is capable of displaying. Additionally this fixes edge cases caused when there was a difference in viewports between users.
- The viewport's dimensions will now dynamically display accurately as they are changed in the header area.
- The viewport's scale will now dynamically display accurately as it is changed.
- Each command will automatically restore the viewport to the dimensions at the time the command was issued. In other words, scrolling over each command will restore exactly what Cypress "saw" when it issued the command.
- Several common viewport presets have been added for convenience

**Misc:**

- Cypress now requires a viewport to be issued at all times. By default it is `1000x660` but can be changed in your `cypress.json` file with he keys: `viewportWidth` and `viewportHeight`.

**Bugfixes:**

- Scrollbar styling is no longer hijacked by Cypress.

**Misc:**

- Updated remote application iframe styles.
