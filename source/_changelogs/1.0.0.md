# 1.0.0

*Released 10/09/2017*

**Summary:**

- `1.0.0` marks our transition out of a **private** beta and into a **public** beta. We've lifted all the restrictions for using Cypress. It is now accessible to everyone. Until we are out of beta, the {% url "Dashboard Service" dashboard-introduction%} will continue to be free.
- We will continue to follow `semver` from this point on (and also a bit more rigorously).
- Cypress is now {% url "open source" https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress %}! This project is licensed under the terms of the {% url "MIT License" https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/LICENSE.md %}.
- We have a {% url "Contributing Guideline" https://on.cypress.io/contributing %} to help contributors get started as well as {% url "issues labeled `first-timers-only`" https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/labels/first-timers-only %} for those wanting to contribute right away.
- You can now use the Test Runner application without logging in. Some areas of the application still require logging in through GitHub, like the 'Runs' tab and viewing the project's 'Record Key'. The only places where login is required is when it interacts with our external servers. Naturally these places are optional and will not affect the local test writing + running experience.
- We've removed the requirement of filling out an early adopter form and approval for logging in with GitHub to Cypress.
- {% url "www.cypress.io" https://www.cypress.io %} has an all new design to help new visitors get started quickly and understand our future pricing more clearly.
- We are still updating the docs to reflect the `1.0.0` release.

**Features:**

- Windows is now supported. We have been running it successfully on EC2 and all of our example projects are also running in CI with AppVeyor. It is still super beta (we're aware of a couple issues already) and we're still updating our own infrastructure to manage and test it as comprehensively as we do OSX and Linux. We are only building a 32bit version of Windows, but will soon be building a 64bit as well. As of today the Windows binary is about 2x the size of what it will be. Unzipping takes a long time, we are sorry. Fixes {% issue 74 %} and {% issue 444 %}.

**Misc:**

- Added the `Beta` flag everywhere (since we are still technically in beta).
- Reduced the frequency the app checked for updates. Fixes {% issue 713 %}.
- The CLI now sends `arch` parameter to the download server so we can build and serve multiple binaries for Windows + Linux.

**Documentation Changes:**

- {% url 'Updated "Installing Cypress"' installing-cypress %}
- {% url 'Updated "Writing your First Test"' writing-your-first-test %}
- Added a 10 minute Getting Started video that {% url 'Andrew Van Slaars' https://github.com/avanslaars %} created.
