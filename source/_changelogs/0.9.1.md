# 0.9.1

*Released 07/03/2015*

**Features:**

- {% url `cy.viewport()` viewport %} can now accept an `orientation` when providing a `preset`. Valid orientations are `landscape` and `portrait`.

**Bugfixes:**

- The scaffolded `spec_helper.js` now correctly returns its object literal in the `onConsole` callback.
- {% url `.type()` type %} now correctly logs its message to the Command Log when provided options.
- {% url `.type()` type %} has been upgraded to handle situations where as it's typing, 3rd party code mutates the value either synchronously or asynchronously. The caret is automatically moved to the end position matching browser behavior.

**Misc:**

- Deprecated `Cypress.command`, instead use `Cypress.Log.command` to output a Command Log. Updated scaffolding on new projects to reflect this change.
- {% url `cy.contains()` contains %} now outputs much more explicit error messages when given command options. Fixes {% issue 49 '#49' %}.
- {% url `cy.route()` route %} no longer validates `response` value when `{respond: false}` is passed in as options. Fixes {% issue 48 '#48' %}.
- {% url `.invoke()` invoke %} and {% url `.its()` its %} will now log out the $el if it's a DOM object, which will now correctly highlight the $el during a command revert. Additionally if these commands have been called on a DOM object, their `onConsole` message will include the DOM objects.
