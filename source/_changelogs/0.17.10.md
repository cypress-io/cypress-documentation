# 0.17.10

*Released 11/07/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed switching between two different spec files from the desktop app causing `document.domain` to be wrong. Fixes {% issue 276 '#276' %}.
- Fixed inserting the string `null` into {% url `cy.request()` request %} urls when providing a `baseUrl` in `cypress.json` while origin could not be determined. Fixes {% issue 274 '#274' %}.
- Fixed incorrect error message on reverse visibility assertions. Fixes {% issue 275 '#275' %}.

**Misc:**

- We've improved the way we inject content into `<html>` responses by filtering the underlying HTTP request headers. We no longer inject content into templates which were loaded via XHR. Fixes {% issue 257 '#257' %} and {% issue 288 '#288' %}.
