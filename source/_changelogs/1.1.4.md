# 1.1.4

*Released 12/6/2017*

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue causing `Chrome` to timeout when attempted to be run through our docker containers. Fixes {% issue 1031 %}.
- Several TypeScript typings were added, updated and fixed. Fixes {% issue 1006 %}.
- Using a regular `http://` URL now works when using the `CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION` flag to point the binary at an external location. Fixes {% issue 1001 %}.
- File watching is fixed (again) when changing between specs. Fixes {% issue 1018 %}.

**Misc:**

- There is now a new {% url `CYPRESS_SKIP_BINARY_INSTALL` installing-cypress#Skipping-installation %} flag you can pass during `npm install` which skips the binary installation after the `cypress` npm module completes its installation. Fixes {% issue 1005 %}.
- We now launch Chrome with `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-gpu` options in Linux. We will soon release a new plugin event that enables you to modify the browser arguments we use by default. This *shouldn't* cause issues with existing Linux users, and instead it should fix many CI setups that were using our Docker containers or your own home grown installed Chrome setup. Fixes {% issue 1021 %} and {% issue 1020 %}.
- Removed several aliases from our browser detector. These were not implemented properly and not needed - and thus only caused indirection. Fixes {% issue 1023 %}.
