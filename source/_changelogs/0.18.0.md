# 0.18.0

*Released 11/27/2016*

**Notes:**

- We've created a new {% url "example recipes repo" https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes %} to show you common testing scenarios including how to use the new module support.

**Summary:**

- We've added automatic ES2015+, module, JSX, and CJSX support to all test files. This means you can use `require`, `import`, or `export` declarations to load other files. You can also use this to import your own application specific JavaScript modules and write unit tests for them. More of these details are yet to come. {% issue 318 'See this issue' %}.
- You can now use your regularly installed `node_modules` in your project to do things like utilizing {% url "`lodash`" https://lodash.com/ %} for utility functions or extending {% url "`chai`" http://www.chaijs.com/ %} with assertion plugins.
- Because we're now processing the spec files prior to handing them off to the browser, this means we will display problems like syntax errors when something in the processing goes wrong. Additionally, we print these out during `cypress run`, so you're not stuck wondering what went wrong.

**Breaking Changes:**

- Previously, we auto-magically included all files within {% url '`cypress/support`' writing-and-organizing-tests#Folder-Structure %}. This has now {% url 'gone away' error-messages %} and we've simplified this to automatically including a single `cypress/support/index.js` file. That single file acts as the entry point meaning you should `import` or `require` the other support files you'd like to include. Although this is still "automatic" it's much less magical and we'll be updating all of our docs to reflect this. The purpose of `cypress/support` hasn't really changed, just the implementation of it has. We will automatically seed a `cypress/support/index.js` file for you (even on existing projects). The file location of `cypress/support/index.js` can be changed with the new {% url `supportFile` configuration#Folders-Files %} option in your `cypress.json`. This feature can also be turned off by specifying `supportFile: false`.

**Features:**

- We now support ES2015+, modules, and JSX in all spec files. Fixes {% issue 246 '#246' %}.
- Spec files may now be written as `.js`, `.jsx`, `.coffee`, or `cjsx` files.
- Test files with JS syntax errors are now {% url 'handled' error-messages %} and we provide a GUI that points to the exact line/column number. Additionally we print these out during `cypress run` and exit the process with `code 1`. Fixes {% issue 293 '#293' %}.

**Misc:**

- We improved the logic around when and if we scaffold files on a new project. We're much smarter about this and not generating these forcibly every time. Fixes {% issue 285 '#285' %}.
- Simplified handling of support files and made them less "magical". Fixes {% issue 286 '#286' %}.
- Renamed `supportFolder` to {% url `supportFile` configuration#Folders-Files %} in `cypress.json`. We will automatically rename your `cypress.json` if this property was present on update.
