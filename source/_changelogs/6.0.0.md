# 6.0.0

*Released 11/23/2020*

**Summary:**

**Breaking Changes:**

**{% fa fa-exclamation-triangle red %} Please read our {% url "Migration Guide" migration-guide %} which explains the changes in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 6.0.**

- DOM elements where the CSS style (or ancestors) are `opacity: 0` are no longer considered visible. However these are still considered {% url "actionable" interacting-with-elements %} and {% url "any action commands"  interacting-with-elements#Actionability %} used to interact with the element will perform the action. This matches browser's implementation on how they regard elements with `opacity: 0`. Addresses {% issue 4474 %}.
- The `experimentalNetworkStubbing` option has been removed and made the default behavior. You can safely removed this configuration option. Addressed in {% issue 9185 %}.
- We removed several deprecation errors around APIs that were removed in versions of Cypress prior to 4.0.0. This will not cause any changes for anyone upgrading from a 4.0+ version of Cypress. For a full list of all APIs affected see {% issue 8946 %}.
- We updated our HTTP status codes and reason phrases to match Node.js `http.STATUS_CODES`. If you have code that relies on a reason phrase, then this could affect you. Addressed in {% issue 8969 %}.

**Deprecations:**

Deprecations still work as before but will be removed from Cypress in a future release. We encourage you to update your code now to remove uses of deprecations.

- `cy.server()` and `cy.route()` have been deprecated. In a future release, support for `cy.server()` and `cy.route()` will be moved to a plugin. We encourage you to use {% url "`cy.http()`" http %} instead. Addressed in {% issue 9185 %}.
- `experimentalFetchPolyfill` has been deprecated. We encourage you to use {% url "`cy.http()`" http %} to intercept requests using the Fetch API instead.
- `cy.route2()` was renamed to {% url "`cy.http()`" http %}. We encourage you to update usages of `cy.route2()` to use {% url "`cy.http()`" http %}. Addressed in {% issue 9182 %}.

**Features:**

- We now pass `—disable-dev-shm-usage` to the Chrome browser flags by default. This will write shared memory files into `/tmp` instead of `/dev/shm`. If you're passing this flag in your `plugins` file, you can now remove this code. Addresses {% issue 5336 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

**Documentation Changes:**

- Our {% url "Migration Guide" migration-guide %} has a new section for 6.0 migration.
- Many of our docs examples have been updated to use {% url "`cy.http()`" http %} in place of `cy.route()` including our {% url "Network Requests" network-requests %} doc.
