# 0.13.9

*Released 01/28/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent regression with not automatically scaling the viewport to fit into the window size

**Misc:**

- Update links to match new {% url "documentation" https://docs.cypress.io %}
- {% url `.debug()` debug %} has been zipped up - it no longer logs confusing debugging information and now logs information about the previously run command.
- {% url `Cypress._` _ %}, {% url `Cypress.$` $ %}, {% url `Cypress.Promise` promise %}, {% url `Cypress.Blob` blob %}, `Cypress.moment` utilities have been moved off of `cy` and are now attached to `Cypress`. This is much more consistent with how the `cy` and `Cypress` APIs work. You can continue to use these objects off of `cy` but this has been deprecated and you will see a warning message.
