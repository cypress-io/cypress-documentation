# 0.6.2

*Released 05/20/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- Using the `length` option in `querying` or `traversal` commands now logs out in the Command Log. Fixes {% issue 40 '#40' %}.
- Other scenarios are fixed where command options would show incorrect number of object keys due to a bug in underscore's `reduce` with an object that has a `length` key. Fixes {% issue 35 '#35' %}.
