# 4.0.0

*Released 2/3/2020*

**Summary:**

Cypress 4.0.0 includes beta support for {% url "Mozilla Firefox" https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/ %} browsers and support {% url "Microsoft Edge" https://www.microsoft.com/edge %} (Chromium based) browsers which is a big step forward for {% url "Cross Browser Testing" cross-browser-testing %} in Cypress. We've also updated many of the {% url "underlying tools" bundled-tools %} behind Cypress that bring new powerful features.

**Breaking Changes:**

**Please read our {% url "Migration Guide" migration-guide %} which explains the changes in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 4.0.**

- The minimum Node.js version supported by Cypress is now Node 8. Addresses {% issue 5632 %}.
- Due to upgrading Mocha, invoking a `done` callback and returning a promise in a test now results in an error. Addresses {% issue 2528 %}.
- Chai has been upgraded which includes a number of breaking changes and new features. Addresses {% issue 2529 %}.
- Sinon.JS has been upgraded which includes a number of breaking changes and new features. Addresses {% issue 2866 %}.
- During `before:browser:launch`, we no longer yield the second argument as an array of browser arguments and instead yield an `options` object with an `args` property in order to support more advanced browser launch options. Addresses {% issue 6306 %}.
- We updated the {% url "Cypress browser objects" browser-launch-api %} of all Chromium-based browsers, including Electron, to have `chromium` set as their `family` field. Addresses {% issue 6243 %}.
- The {% url "`--browser` flag" command-line#cypress-run-browser-lt-browser-name-or-path-gt %} no longer accepts a release candidate browser as its sole argument. You can now specify a specific release channel of a browser by prepending it with the browser name. Addresses {% issue 6243 %}.
