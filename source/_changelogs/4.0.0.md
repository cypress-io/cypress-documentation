# 4.0.0

*Released 2/6/2020*

**Summary:**

Cypress 4.0.0 includes support for {% url "Mozilla Firefox" https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/ %} browsers (beta support) and {% url "Microsoft Edge" https://www.microsoft.com/edge %} (Chromium based) browsers which is a big step forward for {% url "Cross Browser Testing" cross-browser-testing %} in Cypress. We've also updated many of the {% url "underlying tools" bundled-tools %} behind Cypress that bring new powerful features.

**Breaking Changes:**

**{% fa fa-exclamation-triangle red %} Please read our {% url "Migration Guide" migration-guide %} which explains the changes in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 4.0.**

- Mocha, Chai, and Sinon.JS has been upgraded which includes a number of breaking changes and new features. Addresses {% issue 2528 %}, {% issue 2529 %}, {% issue 2866 %}.
- During `before:browser:launch`, we no longer yield the second argument as an array of browser arguments and instead yield an `options` object with an `args` property in order to support more advanced browser launch options. Addresses {% issue 6306 %}.
- We updated the {% url "Cypress browser objects" browser-launch-api %} of all Chromium-based browsers, including Electron, to have `chromium` set as their `family` field. Addresses {% issue 6243 %}.

- {% url "`.contains()`" contains %} now ignores leading, trailing, duplicate whitespaces. Addresses {% issue 92 %}.
