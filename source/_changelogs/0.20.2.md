# 0.20.2

*Released 10/06/2017*

**Possibly Breaking Changes:**

- {% url "`cy.exec()`" exec %} now trims output by default. That means if you were using an `eq` assertion the output will no longer have a trailing newline character `\n`. It's unlikely you are doing this, but it is possible you may need to update your assertions to remove this character. Fixes {% issue 697 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- Handle errors gracefully when Electron window has been closed before paint events happen. Fixes {% issue 705 %}.
- Basic auth now works *again*. Fixes {% issue 573 %}.
- {% url "`cy.exec()`" exec %} now properly sources each time it is invoked instead of only once. Fixes {% issue 694 %}.

**Misc:**

- `cypress open` now accepts the `--project` flag which enables you to use a root level Cypress installation and point to multiple sub projects. Fixes {% issue 661 %}.
- Prevent newer versions of Chrome from prompting you to save passwords and suppressed other extension related popups for Windows. Fixes {% issue 704 %}.
