# 0.4.0

*Released 04/02/2015*

**Features:**

- `sinon-as-promised` is now a bundled extension.
- tests without an `id` now run (with a random temporarily assigned id).
- tests with a duplicate `id` to another test will now run (with a random temporarily assigned id).
- tests or suites which are manually re-run from the UI now hide all of the other tests / suites.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed hook failure associated to wrong failed current test when `grep` was set.
- Async tests which used a `cy` command and had a `done` callback was always undefined.  Now it's back to real mocha `function done(err)`.
- Fixed bug in mocha where it incorrectly associates `hook.ctx.currentTest` to the wrong `test`. {% url "Mocha Issue" https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/1638 %}.
- {% url `cy.title()` title %} no longer logs twice on a failure.
- Fixed putting an `.only` on a large list of tests that would sometimes not clear the previous runnables in the UI.

**Misc:**

- Optimized first test run after hard refresh.
- Performance improvements on successive runnable iterations.
- Aborting currently running tests performance improvement.
- Live reload performance improvements when tests are changed.
- Added 100+ tests covering Runner + Reporter behavior.
- Aggressively cleaned up listeners after each test completion + run.
- Added additional `Cypress` events for 3rd party custom handling.
