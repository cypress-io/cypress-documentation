# 0.11.6

*Released 09/25/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- Viewport is now properly restored to the default width / height after on subsequent runs. Previously it would retain the last viewport sized sed until there was a new viewport command.
- {% url "`cy.should('contain', '...')`" should %} now correctly escapes quotes and single quotes.
- Assertion messages are no longer truncated, and instead will scale down by reducing the `font-size` and `line-height` after they exceed 110 characters. So you'll now always see the full assertion message.
- Fixed some scenarios where assertions would not be logged as a child command.
- Assertions based around the `window` or `document` object no longer cause `chai` to bomb on formatting their object structures (due to yclic references) and instead now will show up as `<window>` and `<document>`.

**Misc:**

- {% url `cy.window()` window %} now logs out to the `Command Log` and additionally verifies upcoming assertions.
- {% url `cy.document()` document %} now logs out to the `Command Log` and additionally verifies upcoming assertions.
- Removed `numElements` label on assertions which indicated the number of elements found if > 1. This was annoying and redundant since the inked command already had this number.
