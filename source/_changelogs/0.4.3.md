# 0.4.3

*Released 04/09/2015*

**Features:**

- Added functionality which enables {% url `cy.server()` server %} and {% url `cy.route()` route %} to be created prior to {% url `cy.visit()` visit %}. The server and routes will apply to the next page which is visited. This allows you to stub requests which happen on page load. Suggested in {% issue 17 '#17' %}.
- {% url `cy.visit()` visit %} now takes an optional `onBeforeLoad` callback option which is invoked when your page begins to ender but prior to its load event.

**Misc:**

- Improved error message when attempting to use `cy.agents` or anything else which requires a remote sandbox.  Fixes {% issue 12 '#12' %}.
