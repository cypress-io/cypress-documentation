# 0.18.5

*Released 01/08/2017*

**Features:**

- You can now disable `videoCompression` by passing `false` in `cypress.json` or env variables. In very long runs and on CPU throttled instances compression can take a considerable amount of time, possibly as much as 50% of the time spent running actual tests. Fixes {% issue 372 '#372' %}.

**Misc:**

- Improved performance when running `cypress run` by caching the last bundled spec. This prevents having the same spec file rebundled each time {% url `cy.visit()` visit %} caused a full page navigation. You should see a moderate improvement in test run time. Fixes {% issue 370 '#370' %}.
- We are now capturing `stdout` and several other properties for use + display in our Dashboard on `cypress ci` runs.
- Enable {% url `cy.fixture()` fixture %} to send an encoding for images other than forcing the default encoding of `base64`. Fixes {% issue 373 '#373' %}.
- Enable {% url `cy.route()` route %} to pass an `encoding` parameter when using `fx:fixture` syntax. Fixes {% issue 374 '#374' %}.
