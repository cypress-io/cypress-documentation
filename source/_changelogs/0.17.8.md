# 0.17.8

*Released 10/13/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed `opener of undefined` errors due to `page load` events causing snapshots prior to the `load` event of the remote application. Thanks to everyone who helped pitched in on this one! Fixes {% issue 258 '#258' %}.
- Cypress now correctly sets cookies with `expirationDate` in the past. Chrome did not handle these cookies as documented and our code did not take this into account. We also added a lot more `e2e` tests around this behavior. Fixes {% issue 266 '#266' %}.
- We are now taking additional precautions to prevent Cypress from trashing the wrong folder during an upgrade (with an open project). This was actually fixed in `0.17.7` but the problem was is that during an update, the new version (which was fixed) was still being passed the wrong arguments from the older (broken) application. We've now upgraded `0.17.8` to detect this, and just use the expected default install location of Cypress. If you're concerned, just *close* your currently open project before updating. Fixes {% issue 265 '#265' %}.

**Misc:**

- When an in app update fails in `linux` we now provide instructions on how to manually update Cypress.
- We now properly take the `maxAge` cookie flag into account and give it preference over the `expires` flag as per the cookie spec.
