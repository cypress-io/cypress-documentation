# 3.5.0

*Released 10/23/2019*

**Features:**

- We now record video by default when you run Cypress in Chrome, Chromium, or Canary such as during {% url "`cypress run --browser chrome`" command-line#cypress-run-browser-lt-browser-name-or-path-gt %}. Addresses {% issue 4608 %}.
- There is a new {% url "`.rightclick()`" rightclick %} command to right click on DOM elements. Addresses {% issue 53 %}.
- Cypress now accepts a {% url "`--config-file` argument" command-line#cypress-run-config-file-lt-config-file-gt %} to specify a different file to be used for Cypress configuration. You can also pass `false` to the `--config-file` to not use any configuration file. Addresses {% issue 1369 %}.
- You can now use your system's Node version by setting the {% url "`nodeVersion`" configuration#Node-version %} to `system` in your configuration.

If not set, Cypress will continue to use the Node version bundled with Cypress. Addresses {% issue 4432 %}.
