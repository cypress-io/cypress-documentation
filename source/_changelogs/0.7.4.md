# 0.7.4

*Released 06/18/2015*

**Misc:**

- Attempting to {% url `.click()` click %} a select element will now throw an error. The error guides you to using the {% url `.select()` select %} command, as that is the command you should use to change a `<select>` value.
- {% url `cy.route()` route %} responses are now validated. If responses are `null` or `undefined` Cypress will throw a very specific error message.
- Cypress will now display `cypress.json` parse errors when attempting to boot a project when there is a syntax error in `cypress.json`.
