# 0.6.8

*Released 06/05/2015*

**Features:**

- {% url `cy.clearCookie()` clearcookie %} and {% url `cy.clearCookies()` clearcookies %} have been added as new commands.
- Cypress will automatically clear all cookies **before** each test run.
- Named the spec + app iframe so that inside of Chrome Dev Tools the iframe selector will clearly distinguish which iframe is your application versus Cypress.

**Bugfixes:**

- Hitbox is no longer covered up by element layers on DOM revert.
- Finally tracked down and fixed edge case causing empty view to display when tests were not empty. Fixes {% issue 13 '#13' %}

**Misc:**

- {% url `cy.visit()` visit %} now accepts `{log: false}` to prevent logging out (useful in custom commands).
- {% url `cy.contains()` contains %} is now scoped by default to the `<body>` instead of `document` which prevents it from returning elements in the `head` like `title`.
