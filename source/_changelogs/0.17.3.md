# 0.17.3

*Released 09/11/2016*

**Features:**

- When `visible` assertions such as `should('be.visible')` fail we now print the reason Cypress thought the element was invisible. Matches what Cypress prints out when attempting to interact with invisible elements. Fixes {% issue 221 '#221' %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent `Host` header from having its port appended when request was for port `80` or `443` which lead to 3rd party reverse proxy problems such as with `zeit.co` hosting. Fixes {% issue 222 '#222' %}.
- Send valid http response errors, and display new lines correctly. Fixes {% issue 218 '#218' %}.
- Correctly inject on `5xx` http response codes. Fixes {% issue 217 '#217' %}.
- Correctly inject on `4xx` and other bad http response codes when using Cypress as the file server. Fixes {% issue 219 '#219' %}.
- Correctly inject on `gzip` errors from 3rd party servers doing unintended things. Fixes {% issue 220 '#220' %}.
