# 0.11.9

*Released 10/03/2015*

**Features:**

- Added `.zip` as acceptable fixture extension. Content is sent back as `base64`.
- Added docs to nav, consolidated `organize` into `tests`.
- Added favicon.
- Added tooltips everywhere.
- Created new debugging command: {% url `.pause()` pause %} which will pause executing commands and allow you to resume or step into the next command one at a time.
- You can now stop and restart tests from the UI.
- Added `cy.Blob` utilities for `blob` / `string` / `base64` conversion. Useful for manually handling uploads.

**Bugfixes:**

- "Cannot revert DOM while tests are running" now removes itself correctly.
- Aliased DOM objects are now correctly stored on the test's `ctx` as instances of **your** jQuery (if one exists).

**Misc:**

- Updated UI styles / tests list / run all.
- Fixed alt tray icon so it shows up correctly on click.
