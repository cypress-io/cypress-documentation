# 0.10.3

*Released 08/10/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress Errors in `hooks` (beforeEach, etc) will no longer cause Mocha to fire its `end` event thus ending the entire run. In CI, this would ause the test suite to end early. Uncaught Mocha errors will however continue this behavior. Cypress does not yet have a "skipped" visual state or tests which were skipped, so at the moment it may look a little strange and unpredictable.

**Misc:**

- Tweaked clicking algorithm to re-verify an elements visibility anytime the click retries its `retry` logic. Previously this check only appened once at the beginning of the click.
- In CI, the window size (not the viewport) has been changed from `1024x768` to `1280x720`. This will only affect `screenshot` artifacts which re taken automatically with {% url `cy.screenshot()` screenshot %} (coming soon) or whenever a test fails (also coming soon).
