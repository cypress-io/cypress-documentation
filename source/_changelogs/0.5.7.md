# 0.5.7

*Released 04/23/2015*

**Features:**

- The insanity that is URL parsing to figure out absolute, relative, absolute-path-relative, http, sub domains, and local files should work in most cases. In other words, Cypress has implemented the vast majority of url parsing based on the {% url 'w3c URL spec' 'https://url.spec.whatwg.org' %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent reverting the DOM while tests are running. Fixes {% issue 28 '#28' %}.
- Fix edge case with forced focusing / blurring an element when document is not in focus and the element is no longer in the DOM.
- Visiting relative paths which are served from your file system works again.
- Visiting absolute paths in the iframe now displays the correct URL in the address bar again.
