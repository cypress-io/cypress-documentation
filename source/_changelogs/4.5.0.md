# 4.5.0

*Released 4/28/2020*

**Features:**

- Cypress now supports the execution of component tests using framework-specific adaptors when setting the {% url "`experimentalComponentTesting`" configuration#Experiments %} configuration option to `true`.  For more details see the {% url "cypress-react-unit-test" https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test %} and {% url "cypress-vue-unit-test" https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-vue-unit-test %} repos. Addresses {% issue 5922 %} and {% issue 6968 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- {% url "Custom Mocha reporters" reporters %} will now correctly use the version of Mocha bundled with Cypress. Fixes {% issue 3537 %} and {% issue 6984 %}.
- We better account for word boundaries in application scripts when `modifyObstructiveCode` is `true`. Fixes {% issue 7138 %}.
- Fixed an issue where iterators in TypeScript were not properly transpiled. Fixes {% issue 7098 %}.

**Misc:**

- The update window in the Test Runner now encourages yarn users to `yarn upgrade` Cypress instead of `yarn add` to help prevent installing 2 versions of Cypress when using yarn workspaces. Addressed in {% PR 7101 %}.
- We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses {% issue 2690 %} in {% PR 7031 %} and {% PR 7097 %}.

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` from `8.2.0` to `8.2.3`. Addressed in {% PR 7079 %}.
