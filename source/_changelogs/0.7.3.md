# 0.7.3

*Released 06/17/2015*

**Features:**

- {% url `.select()` select %} will now output a command log.
- {% url `.select()` select %} will now have `click` / `focus` events fired on itself and the selected options (as per the pec).
- {% url `.select()` select %} is now inline with the other `Action` commands and will retry until the element naturally becomes selectable.

**Bugfixes:**

- `Action` command options are now properly formatted, instead of saying `Object{4}` they will display the overridden default options - ie: `force`, `timeout`, `interval`.
- Sending `{force: true}` to `Action` commands will no longer error out if the element is not visible. Forcing the action to take place now correctly removes all error checking prior to issuing the action and events.

**Misc:**

- Removed stack traces on `AssertionErrors` in the console since those come from `chai` and are basically useless.
