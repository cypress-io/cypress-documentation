# 0.5.8

*Released 04/24/2015*

**Features:**

- {% url `.as()` as %} can now alias primitives and objects other than routes or DOM.
- {% url `.as()` as %} automatically assigns this alias to `runnable.ctx` which makes it available synchronously.
- {% url `.as()` as %} does not allow several reserved words and will throw if you attempt to alias as one of them.
- {% url `cy.get()` get %} can now accept all alias types and will display the labels in the UI differently based on the alias type.
- Cypress now displays a message when the Desktop App update is actually being applied instead of doing nothing and looking like it's crashed.

**Bugfixes:**

- {% url `.as()` as %} now throws on empty strings or non string arguments.
- Desktop App debug logs no longer sort in the wrong direction.
- Permissions are now restored during a cypress update for the `logs` and `cache`.
- Prevent 3rd party windows from gaining focus over main window.

**Misc:**

- Removed `cy.assign`, this has been folded into {% url `.as()` as %}.
- Updated `chokidar` to `1.0.1`.
