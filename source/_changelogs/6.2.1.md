# 6.2.1

*Released 1/4/2021*

**Bugfixes:**

- Test retries, when retrying on several failed tests, will no longer cause hanging during `cypress run`. Fixes {% issue 9040 %}.
- `multipart/form-data` is no longer wrongly encoded when using {% url "`cy.intercept()`" intercept %}. This should prevent `Unexpected end of multipart data` errors on the back end service where the request was pointing to. Fixes {% issue 9359 %}.
- {% url "`cy.contains()`" contains %} no longer throws an error when a single quote is used inside its argument when RegExp. Fixes {% issue 8626 %}.
- Passing `capture: 'runner'` to a {% url "`cy.screenshot()`" screenshot %} command inside {% url "`.within()`" within %} now screenshots the entire Test Runner as expected. Fixes {% issue 14253 %}.
- {% url "`Cypress.dom.isJquery()`" dom#Is-jQuery %} now always returns a boolean instead of `undefined` sometimes. Fixes {% issue 14278 %}.
- `calledOnceWith` and `calledOnceWithExactly` sinon matchers no longer throw an error when used within Cypress. Fixes {% issue 9644 %}.
- We now pass `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows` as a default flag to Chrome to prevent backgrounding rendering when the Cypress window is occluded. Fixes {% issue 9604 %}.

**Misc:**

- After login, if a name is undefined on your profile, the Test Runner will show the profile's email and link to instructions to update the name. Addresses {% issue 14288 %}.

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `devtools-protocol` from `0.0.734984` to `0.0.839267`. Addressed in {% issue 14353 %}.
- Upgraded `electron` from `11.0.3` to `11.1.1`. Addressed in {% issue 14352 %}.
