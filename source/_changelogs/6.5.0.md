# 6.5.0

*Released 2/15/2021*

**Performance:**

- Improved the startup time of `cypress open` and `cypress run`. Addresses {% issue 15075 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where tests would display as failed if an event (such as an XHR request) failed after the test was already completed. This only affects the display of the test and not what was reported in run mode, so it would not have had an effect on suites running in CI. Addresses {% issue 14978 %}.
- Fixed a regression introduced in 6.4.0 that caused Electron to crash when opening outside links in the Command Log. Addresses {% issue 14912 %}.
- Fixed an issue where browser paths with double backslashes would not work as expected on Windows. Addresses {% issue 14719 %}.
- Fixed Microsoft Edge browser detection when passing a path on Windows. Addresses {% issue 14716 %}.
- Fixed an issue where the types for `Cypress.on` did not support chaining. Addresses {% issue 14991 %}.
- Fixed an issue where, when installing two Cypress instances simultaneously, the downloaded `.zip` could become corrupted and break the install process. Addresses {% issue 4595 %}.

**Misc:**

- Expanded search bar in desktop GUI to fill the entire width. Addresses {% issue 14830 %}.
- Added `autoEnd` to the types for `LogConfig`. Addresses {% issue 9590 %}.

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` to version `11.2.3`. Addresses {% issue 15056 %}.
