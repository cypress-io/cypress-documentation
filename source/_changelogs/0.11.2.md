# 0.11.2

*Released 09/14/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevented bug where the assertion message: `expected <x> element to exist` would log over and over again when Cypress retried querying for a DOM element.

**Misc:**

- {% url `.root()` root %} now outputs its subject when clicking on its command log. Fixes {% issue 55 '#55' %}.
