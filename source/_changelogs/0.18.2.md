# 0.18.2

*Released 12/15/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- Under the hood {% url `cy.visit()` visit %} now sets an `Accept: text/html,*/*` request header to prevent some web servers from sending back `404` in the case where they required this header. Only a small % of servers would ever do this, but `webpack-dev-server` was one of them. Fixes {% issue 309 '#309' %}.
- {% url `cy.request()` request %} now sends an `Accept: */*` request header by default too. Fixes {% issue 338 '#338' %}.

**Misc:**

- {% url `cy.request()` request %} now includes more debugging information (related to headers) in the error output. Fixes {% issue 341 '#341' %}.
- When {% url `cy.request()` request %} times out, we now output much better error messages including information about the request sent. Fixes {% issue 340 '#340' %}.
