## What's covered

We will start by cloning a starter {% url "repository" https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-tutorial-build-todo-starter %}. This repo already has the build and server configuration handled. We will take a look at the project's [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) dependencies and scripts, then jump right into getting Cypress up and running.
