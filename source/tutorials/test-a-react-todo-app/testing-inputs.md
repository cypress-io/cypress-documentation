## What you'll learn

We will work through creating our first real test and implementing the feature under test as we go. We will see how to find and interact with elements on the page and how to make assertions about their behavior. We will also look into some best practices like using `beforeEach` and defining our application's {% url "`baseUrl`" configuration#Global %} to remove duplicated code.
