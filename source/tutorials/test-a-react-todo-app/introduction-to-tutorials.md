## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk through building a "Todo" application in {% url "React" https://reactjs.org/ %} while testing it with Cypress. We will look at ways we can use Cypress to not only create a test suite for our application, but help us write our tests and guide feature implementation.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a feel for what it is like to test your application with Cypress while implementing features. You will gain experience with many of the Cypress {% url "commands" api %} and see how Cypress can help you build your application while creating a great safety net of tests along the way.

We have a lot of ground to cover, so let's get started!
