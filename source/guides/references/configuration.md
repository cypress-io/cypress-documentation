title: Configuration
---

When a project is added to Cypress, a `cypress.json` file is created in the project. This file is used to store the `projectId` ({% url 'after configuring your tests to record' projects#Setup %}) and any configuration values you supply.

{% note warning Change Configuration File %}
You can change the configuration file or turn off the use of a configuration file by using the {% url "`--config-file` flag" command-line#cypress-open-config-file-lt-config-file-gt %}.
{% endnote %}

# Options

The default behavior of Cypress can be modified by supplying any of the following configuration options. Below is a list of available options and their default values.

## Global

----- | ---- | ----
`baseUrl` | `null` | URL used as prefix for {% url `cy.visit()` visit %} or {% url `cy.request()` request %} command's URL
`env` | `{}` | Any values to be set as {% url 'environment variables' environment-variables %}
`numTestsKeptInMemory` | `50` | The number of tests for which snapshots and command data are kept in memory. Reduce this number if you are experiencing high memory consumption in your browser during a test run.
`port` | `null` | Port used to host Cypress. Normally this is a randomly generated port
`reporter` | `spec` | The {% url 'reporter' reporters %} used during `cypress run`
`reporterOptions` | `null` | The {% url 'reporter options' reporters#Reporter-Options %} used. Supported options depend on the reporter.
`retries` | `{ "runMode": 0, "openMode": 0 }` | The number of times to retry a failing test. Can be configured to apply to `cypress run` or `cypress open` separately. See {% url "Test Retries" test-retries %} for more information.
`watchForFileChanges` | `true` | Whether Cypress will watch and restart tests on test file changes

## Timeouts

{% note success Core Concept %}
{% url 'Timeouts are a core concept' introduction-to-cypress#Timeouts %} you should understand well. The default values listed here are meaningful.
{% endnote %}

Option | Default | Description

----- | ---- | ----
`screenshotOnRunFailure` | `true` | Whether Cypress will take a screenshot when a test fails during `cypress run`.
`screenshotsFolder`     | `cypress/screenshots`     | Path to folder where screenshots will be saved from {% url `cy.screenshot()` screenshot %} command or after a test fails during `cypress run`
`trashAssetsBeforeRuns` | `true` | Whether Cypress will trash assets within the `screenshotsFolder` and `videosFolder` before tests run with `cypress run`.

For more options regarding screenshots, view the {% url 'Cypress.Screenshot API' screenshot-api %}.

## Videos

Option | Default | Description
----- | ---- | ----
`trashAssetsBeforeRuns` | `true` | Whether Cypress will trash assets within the `screenshotsFolder` and `videosFolder` before tests run with `cypress run`.
`videoCompression` | `32` | The quality setting for the video compression, in Constant Rate Factor (CRF). The value can be `false` to disable compression or a value between `0` and `51`, where a lower value results in better quality (at the expense of a higher file size).
`videosFolder`     | `cypress/videos` | Where Cypress will automatically save the video of the test run when tests run with `cypress run`.
`video`     | `true`     | Whether Cypress will capture a video of the tests run with `cypress run`.
`videoUploadOnPasses`     | `true`     | Whether Cypress will process, compress, and upload videos to the {% url "Dashboard" dashboard-introduction%} even when all tests in a spec file are passing. This only applies when recording your runs to the Dashboard. Turn this off if you'd like to only upload the spec file's video when there are failing tests.

## Browser

Option | Default | Description
----- | ---- | ----
`chromeWebSecurity`    | `true`    | Whether to enable Chromium-based browser's Web Security for same-origin policy and insecure mixed content. {% url 'Read more about Web Security' web-security %}.

`firefoxGcInterval` | `{ "runMode": 1, "openMode": null }` | Controls whether Cypress forces Firefox to run garbage collection (GC) cleanup and how frequently. During {% url "`cypress run`" command-line#cypress-run %}, the default value is `1`. During {% url "`cypress open`" command-line#cypress-open %}, the default value is `null`. See full details {% urlHash "here" firefoxGcInterval %}.
`modifyObstructiveCode` | `true` | Whether Cypress will search for and replace obstructive JS code in `.js` or `.html` files. {% urlHash 'Please read the notes for more information on this setting.' modifyObstructiveCode %}
`userAgent` | `null` | Enables you to override the default user agent the browser sends in all request headers. User agent values are typically used by servers to help identify the operating system, browser, and browser version. See {% url "User-Agent MDN Documentation" https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent %} for example user agent values.

## Viewport

Option | Default | Description
----- | ---- | ----
`viewportHeight` | `660` | Default height in pixels for the application under tests' viewport (Override with {% url `cy.viewport()` viewport %} command)
`viewportWidth` | `1000` | Default width in pixels for the application under tests' viewport. (Override with {% url `cy.viewport()` viewport %} command)

## Animations

Option | Default | Description
----- | ---- | ----
`animationDistanceThreshold` | `5` | The distance in pixels an element must exceed over time to be considered animating
`waitForAnimations` | `true` | Whether to wait for elements to finish animating before executing commands

## Node version

Option | Default | Description
----- | ---- | ----
`nodeVersion` | `bundled` | If set to `system`, Cypress will try to find a Node executable on your path to use when executing your {% url plugins plugins-guide %}. Otherwise, Cypress will use the Node version bundled with Cypress.

The Node version printed in the Node.js Version panel is used in Cypress to:

- Build files in the {% url "`integrationFolder`" configuration#Folders-Files %}.
- Build files in the {% url "`supportFolder`" configuration#Folders-Files %}.
- Execute code in the {% url "`pluginsFile`" configuration#Folders-Files %}.

Cypress comes automatically bundled with a set Node version by default.

You may want to use a different Node version if the code executing from the plugins file requires features present in a different Node version from the Node version bundled with Cypress. You can use the Node version detected on your system by setting the {% url "`nodeVersion`" configuration#Node-version %} configuration to `system`.

{% imgTag /img/guides/test-runner-settings-nodejs-version.jpg "Node version in Settings in Test Runner" %}

## Experiments

Configuration might include experimental options currently being tested. See {% url Experiments experiments %} page.

# Overriding Options

Cypress gives you the option to dynamically alter configuration values. This is helpful when running Cypress in multiple environments and on multiple developer machines.

This gives you the option to do things like override the `baseUrl` or environment variables.

## Command Line

When {% url 'running Cypress from the Command Line' command-line %} you can pass a `--config` flag.

### Examples:

```shell
cypress open --config pageLoadTimeout=30000,baseUrl=https://myapp.com
```

```shell
cypress run --config integrationFolder=tests,videoUploadOnPasses=false
```

```shell
cypress run --browser firefox --config viewportWidth=1280,viewportHeight=720
```

For more complex configuration objects, you may want to consider passing a {% url "JSON.stringified" https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify %} object surrounded by single quotes.

```shell
cypress open --config '{"watchForFileChanges":false,"testFiles":["**/*.js","**/*.ts"]}'
```

## Plugins

You can programmatically modify configuration values using Node within the `pluginsFile`. This enables you to do things like:

- Use `fs` and read off configuration values and dynamically change them.
- Edit the list of browsers found by default by Cypress

While this may take a bit more work than other options - it yields you the most amount of flexibility and the ability to manage configuration however you'd like.

{% url "We've fully documented how to do this here." configuration-api %}

## Environment Variables

You can also use {% url 'environment variables' environment-variables %} to override configuration values. This is especially useful in {% url 'Continuous Integration' continuous-integration %} or when working locally. This gives you the ability to change configuration options without modifying any code or build scripts.

By default, any environment variable that matches a corresponding configuration key will override the configuration file (`cypress.json` by default) value.

```shell
export CYPRESS_VIEWPORT_WIDTH=800
```

```shell
export CYPRESS_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=600
```

We automatically normalize both the key and the value. Cypress will *strip off* the `CYPRESS_`, camelcase any keys and automatically convert values into `Number` or `Boolean`. Make sure to prefix your environment variables with `CYPRESS_` else they will be ignored.

### Both options below are valid

```shell
export CYPRESS_pageLoadTimeout=100000
```

```shell
export CYPRESS_PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT=100000
```

{% note warning  %}
Environment variables that do not match configuration keys will instead be set as regular environment variables for use in your tests with `Cypress.env()`.

You can {% url 'read more about Environment Variables' environment-variables %}.
{% endnote %}

## `Cypress.config()`

You can also override configuration values within your test using {% url `Cypress.config()` config %}.

{% note warning Scope %}
Configuration set using `Cypress.config` _is only in scope for the current spec file._
{% endnote %}

```javascript
Cypress.config('pageLoadTimeout', 100000)

Cypress.config('pageLoadTimeout') // => 100000
```

## Test Configuration

To apply specific Cypress {% url "configuration" configuration %} values to a suite or test, pass a configuration object to the test or suite function as the second argument.

The configuration values passed in will only take effect during the suite or test where they are set. The values will then reset to the previous default values after the suite or test is complete.

{% partial allowed_test_config %}

### Suite configuration

You can configure the number of times to retries a suite of tests if they fail during `cypress run` and `cypress open` separately.

```js
describe('login', {
  retries: {
    runMode: 3,
    openMode: 2
  }
}, () => {
  it('should redirect unauthenticated user to sign-in page', () => {
    // ...
  })

  it('allows user to login', () => {
    // ...
  })
})
```

### Single test configuration

If you want to target a test to run or be excluded when run in a specific browser, you can override the `browser` configuration within the test configuration. The `browser` option accepts the same arguments as {% url "`Cypress.isBrowser()`" isbrowser %}.

```js
it('Show warning outside Chrome', {  browser: '!chrome' }, () => {
  cy.get('.browser-warning')
    .should('contain', 'For optimal viewing, use Chrome browser')
})
```

# Resolved Configuration

When you open a Cypress project, clicking on the **Settings** tab will display the resolved configuration to you. This helps you to understand and see where different values came from. Each set value is highlighted to show where the value has been set via the following ways:

- Default value
- The {% url "configuration file" configuration %}
- The {% url "Cypress environment file" environment-variables#Option-2-cypress-env-json %}
- System {% url "environment variables" environment-variables#Option-3-CYPRESS %}
- {% url "Command Line arguments" command-line %}
- {% url "Plugin file" configuration-api %}

{% imgTag /img/guides/configuration/see-resolved-configuration.jpg "See resolved configuration" %}

# Notes

## blockHosts

By passing a string or array of strings you can block requests made to one or more hosts.

To see a working example of this please check out our {% url 'Stubbing Google Analytics Recipe' recipes#Stubbing-and-spying %}.

To block a host:

- {% fa fa-check-circle green %} Pass only the host
- {% fa fa-check-circle green %} Use wildcard `*` patterns
- {% fa fa-check-circle green %} Include the port other than `80` and `443`
- {% fa fa-exclamation-triangle red %} Do **NOT** include protocol: `http://` or `https://`

{% note info %}
Not sure what a part of the URL a host is? {% url 'Use this guide as a reference.' https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_strings_and_url_objects %}

When blocking a host, we use {% url `minimatch` minimatch %} to check the host. When in doubt you can test whether something matches yourself.
{% endnote %}

Given the following URLs:

```text
https://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js

http://localhost:1234/some/user.json
```

This would match the following blocked hosts:

```text
www.google-analytics.com
*.google-analytics.com
*google-analytics.com

localhost:1234
```

Because `localhost:1234` uses a port other than `80` and `443` it **must be included**.

{% note warning "Subdomains" %}
Be cautious for URL's which have no subdomain.

For instance given a URL: `https://google.com/search?q=cypress`

- {% fa fa-check-circle green %} Matches `google.com`
- {% fa fa-check-circle green %} Matches `*google.com`
- {% fa fa-exclamation-triangle red %} Does NOT match `*.google.com`
{% endnote %}

When Cypress blocks a request made to a matching host, it will automatically send a `503` status code. As a convenience it also sets a `x-cypress-matched-blocked-host` header so you can see which rule it matched.

{% imgTag /img/guides/blocked-host.png "Network tab of dev tools with analytics.js request selected and the response header highlighted " %}

## modifyObstructiveCode

With this option enabled - Cypress will search through the response streams coming from your server on `.html` and `.js` files and replace code that {% url 'matches the following patterns.' https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/886#issuecomment-364779884 %}

These script patterns are antiquated and deprecated security techniques to prevent clickjacking and framebusting. They are a relic of the past and are no longer necessary in modern browsers. However many sites and applications still implement them.

These techniques prevent Cypress from working, and they can be safely removed without altering any of your application's behavior.

Cypress modifies these scripts at the network level, and therefore there is a tiny performance cost to search the response streams for these patterns.

You can turn this option off if the application or site you're testing **does not** implement these security measures. Additionally it's possible that the patterns we search for may accidentally rewrite valid JS code. If that's the case, please disable this option.

## firefoxGcInterval

Firefox has a {% url "known bug" https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608501 %} where it does not run its internal garbage collection (GC) fast enough, which can lead to consuming all available system memory and crashing. You can see progress on this issue {% issue 6187 'here' %}.

Cypress prevents Firefox from crashing by forcing Firefox to run its GC cleanup routines between tests.

Running GC is an expensive and **blocking** routine. It adds significant time to the overall run, and causes Firefox to "freeze" for the duration of GC cleanup. This causes the browser not to respond to any user input.

Cypress runs GC cleanup during {% url "`cypress run`" command-line#cypress-run %} only because we don't expect users to interact with the browser - since this is typically run in CI. We've disabled running GC during {% url "`cypress open`" command-line#cypress-open %} because users typically interact with the browser.

Because GC adds additional time to the overall run, we've added the amount of time this routine has taken to the bottom of the Command Log in the Test Runner.

{% imgTag /img/guides/firefox-gc-interval-in-command-log.jpg %}

### Configuration

You can control how often GC cleanup runs via the `firefoxGcInterval` configuration value.

`firefoxGcInterval` controls whether Cypress forces Firefox to run GC cleanup and how frequently.

By default, we force GC cleanup between every test during {% url "`cypress run`" command-line#cypress-run %}, but do not run any GC cleanup during {% url "`cypress open`" command-line#cypress-open %} using the configuration value below:

```json
{
  "firefoxGcInterval": {
    "runMode": 1,
    "openMode": null
  }
}
```

You can override how often Cypress runs GC cleanup by setting the `firefoxGcInterval` config value to:

- `null`, to disable it for both {% url "`cypress run`" command-line#cypress-run %} and {% url "`cypress open`" command-line#cypress-open %}
- a `number`, which sets the interval for both {% url "`cypress run`" command-line#cypress-run %} and {% url "`cypress open`" command-line#cypress-open %}
- an `object` to set different intervals for each mode

**Examples**

Turn off GC cleanup all modes

```json
{
  "firefoxGcInterval": null
}
```

Run GC cleanup before every other test during {% url "`cypress run`" command-line#cypress-run %} and {% url "`cypress open`" command-line#cypress-open %}

```json
{
  "firefoxGcInterval": 2
}
```

Run GC cleanup before every 3rd test during {% url "`cypress run`" command-line#cypress-run %} and disable running GC cleanup during {% url "`cypress open`" command-line#cypress-open %}.

```json
{
  "firefoxGcInterval": {
    "runMode": 3,
    "openMode": null
  }
}
```
