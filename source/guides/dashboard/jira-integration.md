## Creating a Jira issue for a test case

{% note info When to create issues for tests?%}
Jira issues can be created for both passing and failing tests. The most common use case would be to create Jira issues for failing tests to better track and prioritize fixing of pipeline failures within projects managed by Jira workflows.
{% endnote %}

Let's walk through creating a Jira issue for a failing test:

1. Click on a failed test within the "Test Results" view of a test run to open its results panel.

2. Click on the "Create Issue" button within the results panel, which will present the form for creating a Jira issue for the test.
