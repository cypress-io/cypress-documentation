## Personal Orgs

By default, every user of Cypress is given a personal organization - named after you. You cannot delete or edit the name of this default organization.

## Delete Org

You can delete organizations that you own as long as they do not have any projects in the organization. You must first transfer ownership of your projects to another organization before you can delete the organization.

# Billing & Usage

## Open Source Plan

To support the community, we provide the Open Source (OSS) plan for public projects to take advantage of our Dashboard Service with unlimited test runs. To qualify, your project needs just two things:

- Your project is a non-commercial entity
- Source code for your project is available in a public location with an {% url "OSI-approved license" https://opensource.org/licenses %}

## Requesting OSS plan for an org

Follow the following process to request an OSS plan for your project:

1. {% url "Login" https://on.cypress.io/dashboard %} to the Cypress Dashboard, or {% url "create an account" https://on.cypress.io/dashboard %} if you are a new user.
  {% imgTag /img/dashboard/oss-plan-1-login.png "Login or Create Account" "no-border" %}
2. Go the {% url "Organizations page" https://on.cypress.io/dashboard/organizations %} to select the organization you want to associate with an OSS plan. If you have no organizations, you can create one by clicking the **+ Add Organization** button.
> **Note**: Personal organizations cannot be used with an OSS plan.
