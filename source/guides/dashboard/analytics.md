# Usage

## Runs over time

{% imgTag /img/dashboard/analytics/dashboard-analytics-runs-over-time.png "Dashboard Analytics Runs Over Time Screenshot" %}

This report shows the number of runs your organization has recorded to the Cypress Dashboard, broken down by the final status of the run. Each run represents a single invocation of `cypress run --record` for this project, whether in CI or on a local machine.

### Filters

{% imgTag /img/dashboard/analytics/dashboard-analytics-runs-over-time-filters.png "Dashboard Analytics Runs Over Time Filters Screenshot" %}

Results may be filtered by:

- Branch
- Time Range
- Time Interval (Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly)

### Results

{% imgTag /img/dashboard/analytics/dashboard-analytics-runs-over-time-graph.png "Dashboard Analytics Runs Over Time Graph Screenshot" %}

The total runs over time are displayed for passed, failed, running, timed out and errored tests, respective of the filters selected.

The results may be downloaded as a comma-separated values (CSV) file for further analysis.
This can be done via the download icon to the right of the filters.

### Key Performance Indicators

{% imgTag /img/dashboard/analytics/dashboard-analytics-runs-over-time-kpi.png "Dashboard Analytics Runs Over Time KPI Screenshot" %}

Total runs, average per day, passed runs and failed runs are the computed respective of the filters selected.

{% imgTag /img/dashboard/analytics/dashboard-analytics-runs-over-time-table.png "Dashboard Analytics Runs Over Time Table Screenshot" %}

A table of results grouped by date for the time range filter is displayed with passed, failed, running, timed out and errored columns.

# Performance

## Run duration

{% imgTag /img/dashboard/analytics/dashboard-analytics-run-duration.png "Dashboard Analytics Run Duration Screenshot" %}
This report shows the average duration of a Cypress run for your project, including how test parallelization is impacting your total run time. Note that we only include passing runs here â€” failing or errored runs can sway the average away from its typical duration.

## Test suite size

{% imgTag /img/dashboard/analytics/dashboard-analytics-test-suite-size.png "Dashboard Analytics Test Suite Size Screenshot" %}

This report shows how your test suite is growing over time. It calculates the average number of test cases executed per run for each day in the given time period. It excludes runs that errored or timed out since they don't accurately represent the size of your test suite.
