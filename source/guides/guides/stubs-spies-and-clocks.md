# Capabilities

Cypress comes built in with the ability to {% url `cy.stub()` stub %}, {% url `cy.spy()` spy %} or modify your applications {% url `cy.clock()` clock %} - such as controlling `Date`, `setTimeout`, and `setInterval`.

These commands are useful when writing both **unit tests** and **integration tests**.

# Libraries and Tools

Cypress automatically bundles and wraps these libraries:

| Name | What it does |
| --- | ---- |
| [`sinon`](http://sinonjs.org) | provides the {% url `cy.stub()` stub %} and {% url `cy.spy()` spy %} API's |
| [`lolex`](https://github.com/sinonjs/lolex) | provides the {% url `cy.clock()` clock %} and {% url `cy.tick()` tick %} API's |
| [`sinon-chai`](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai) | adds `chai` assertions for stubs and spies |

You can refer to each of these libraries documentation for more examples and explanations.

## Stubs

A stub is a way to modify a function and force its behavior to be controlled by you (the programmer).

A stub is most commonly used in a unit test but is still useful during some integration / e2e tests.

```javascript
// create a standalone stub (generally for use in unit test)
cy.stub()

// replace obj.method() with a stubbed function
cy.stub(obj, "method")

// force obj.method() to return "foo"
cy.stub(obj, "method").returns("foo")

// force obj.method() when called with "bar" argument to return "foo"
cy.stub(obj, "method").withArgs("bar").returns("foo")

// force obj.method() to return a promise which resolves to "foo"
cy.stub(obj, "method").resolves("foo")

// force obj.method() to return a promise rejected with an error
cy.stub(obj, "method").rejects(new Error("foo"))
```

You generally stub a function when it has side effects you are trying to control.

***Common Scenarios:***

- You have a function that accepts a callback, and want to invoke the callback.
- Your function returns a `Promise`, and you want to automatically resolve or reject it.
- You have a function that wraps `window.location` and don't want your application to be navigated.
- You're trying to test your applications "failure path" by forcing things to fail.
- You're trying to test your applications "happy path" by forcing things to pass.
- You want to "trick" your application into thinking it's logged in or logged out.
- You're using `oauth` and want to stub login methods.

## Spies

A spy gives you the ability to "spy" on a function, by being able to capture and then assert that the function was calling with the right arguments, or that the function was called a certain number of times, or even what the return value or context the function was called with.

A spy does **not** modify the behavior of the function - it is left perfectly intact. A spy is most useful when you are testing the contract between multiple functions and you don't care about the side effects the real function may create (if any).

```javascript
cy.spy(obj, "method")
```

{% note info cy.spy() %}
{% url 'Read more about how to use `cy.spy()`' spy %}
{% endnote %}

## Clock

There are situations when it is useful to control your applications `date` and `time` in order to force its behavior or avoid slow tests.

{% url `cy.clock()` clock %} gives you the ability to control:

- `Date`
- `setTimeout`
- `setInterval`

***Common Scenarios:***

- You're polling something in your application with `setInterval` and want to control that.
- You have **throttled** or **debounced** functions which you want to control.

Once you've enabled {% url `cy.clock()` clock %} you can then control time by **ticking** it ahead by milliseconds.

```javascript
cy.clock()
cy.visit("http://localhost:3333")
cy.get("#search").type("foobarbaz")
cy.tick(1000)
```

{% url `cy.clock()` clock %} is special in that it can be called **prior** to visiting your application, and we will automatically bind it to the application on the next {% url `cy.visit()` visit %}. We bind **before** any timers from your application can be invoked. This works identically to {% url `cy.server()` server %} + {% url `cy.route()` route %}.

## Assertions

Once you have a `stub` or a `spy` in hand, you can then create assertions about them.

```javascript
const user = {
  getName: (arg) => {
    return arg
  },

  updateEmail: (arg) => {
    return arg
  },

  fail: () => {
    throw new Error("fail whale")
  }
}

// force user.getName() to return "Jane"
cy.stub(user, "getName").returns("Jane Lane")

// spy on updateEmail but do not change its behavior
cy.spy(user, "updateEmail")

// spy on fail but do not change its behavior
cy.spy(user, "fail")

// invoke getName
const name  = user.getName(123)

// invoke updateEmail
const email = user.updateEmail("jane@devs.com")

try {
  // invoke fail
  user.fail()
  } catch (e) {

}

expect(name).to.eq("Jane Lane")                            // true
expect(user.getName).to.be.calledOnce                      // true
expect(user.getName).not.to.be.calledTwice                 // true
expect(user.getName).to.be.calledWith(123)
expect(user.getName).to.be.calledWithExactly(123)          // true
expect(user.getName).to.be.calledOn(user)                  // true

expect(email).to.eq("jane@devs.com")                       // true
expect(user.updateEmail).to.be.calledWith("jane@devs.com") // true
expect(user.updateEmail).to.have.returned("jane@devs.com") // true

expect(user.fail).to.have.thrown("Error")                  // true
```

# Integration and Extensions

Beyond just integrating these tools together we have also extended and improved the collaboration of these tools.

***Some examples:***

- We replaced Sinon's argument stringifier for a much less noisy, more performant, custom version.
- We improved the `sinon-chai` assertion output by changing what displays during a passing vs failing test.
- We've added aliasing support to `stub` and `spy` API's.
- We automatically restore and teardown `stub`, `spy`, and `clock` between tests.

We also integrated all of these API's directly into the Command Log so you can visually see what's happening in your application.

***We visually indicate when:***

- A `stub` is called
- A `spy` is called
- A `clock` is ticked

When you use aliasing with the {% url `.as()` as %} command, we also correlate those aliases with the calls. This works identically to aliasing a {% url `cy.route()` route %}.

When stubs are created by calling the method `.withArgs(...)` we also visually link these together.

When you click on a stub or spy we also output **incredibly** helpful debugging information.

***For instance we automatically display:***

- The call count (and total number of calls)
- The arguments without transforming them (they are the real arguments)
- The return value of the function
- The context the function was invoked with
