# 2.0.1

*Released 2/16/2018*

**Bugfixes:**

- Using {% url "`cy.contains()`" contains %} with a regexp argument is now properly escaped. Fixes {% issue 1322 %}.
- Fixed a runaway regexp causing large `.js` files to take dozens of seconds to process. This was a regression caused by `2.0.0` with the new {% url "`modifyObstructiveCode`" configuration#Browser %} option. We've optimized the regexp and the performance is back to being almost identical to transparently passing responses through. Fixes {% issue 1330 %}.
