# 0.5.13

*Released 05/04/2015*

**Features:**

- New `cy.message` and `cy.msg` commands in preparation for `cypress-ruby`, `cypress-node`, `cypress-*` packages/gem to talk directly to your back end.

**Bugfixes:**

- Using `querying` or `traversal` commands will no longer throw a 2nd command error when using improper sizzle selectors.
- Argument formatting display for command messages is fixed. There were instances of leading commas, or no commas on some commands.

**Misc:**

- Changed default port from `3000` to `2020` to avoid standard port conflicts with commonly used back ends. Afterall, using Cypress is testing with 2020 vision. ;-)
- Updated `bluebird` to `2.9.25`.
- Began implementation in preparation for **cross browser testing** coming sometime relatively soon.
