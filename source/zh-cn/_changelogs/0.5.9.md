# 0.5.9

*Released 04/26/2015*

**Features:**
- Added {% url `.spread()` spread %} method which spreads an array as individual arguments to a callback function,like {% url `.then()` then %}.
- During an update Cypress will now display the updating message in the same coordinates as when the app was open by clicking the tray icon.
- After an update Cypress will now open back up and show itself in these same coordinates.
- {% url `cy.wait()` wait %} can now accept an array of route aliases which will wait until all have completed.  This array of resolved XHRs will become the next subject.
- Each time an alias in used with a {% url `cy.wait()` wait %}, Cypress will not resolve until the Nth request matching the outing alias responds.  Fixes {% issue 4 '#4' %}.
- {% url `cy.get()` get %} has been upgraded to accept a routing alias.  By default it will yield the last matched request, but also supports special alias properties which return a different request or potentially an array of requests.
