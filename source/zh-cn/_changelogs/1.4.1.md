# 1.4.1

*Released 12/26/2017*

**Bugfixes:**

- Using `DEBUG=cypress:*` now correctly outputs all debugging information on OSX and Linux. Previously output other then `cypress:cli` was ignored due to the CLI ignoring `stderr` from the binary. Fixes {% issue 921 %}.
- `stdout` is now captured correctly in Windows when recording to the Dashboard. Fixes {% issue 977 %} and issue {% issue 711 %}.
- Windows now forcibly displays colors correctly to the terminal. Fixes {% issue 1127 %}.

**Misc:**

- `TTY` is now handled correctly for Linux and OSX. This means that CI providers which turned off colors due to `TTY` being false will now display colors again such as TravisCI. Fixes {% issue 1126 %}.
- We now handle `xvfb` exiting with a non zero status code and display that error to you. This should help with situations where `xvfb` is misconfigured on the system. Fixes {% issue 1113 %}.
- We've added debug output for `xvfb` when `DEBUG=cypress:xvfb` is enabled. Helpful when diagnosing problems with `xvfb`. Fixes {% issue 1128 %}.
- We've added more TypeScript documentation for `cy.*` methods. Fixes {% issue 1117 %}.
- When developing on Cypress, we now start the process through the CLI to bring it into parity with how it works when used in production. Fixes {% issue 838 %}.
- Upgraded various CLI dependencies that were flagged for security warnings. There wasn't an actual security problem - just static analyzers complaining. Fixes {% issue 1103 %}.
