# 0.6.0

*Released 05/14/2015*

**Features:**

- Pushstate application routing now works 100% reliably with NO hacky overrides in all browsers.
- All incompatible `a` / `link` / `form` elements are transparently rewritten to be compatible including FQDN and protocol-less `href` / `src`.
- Cookies are automatically cleared between page refreshes, during app startup, and leaving the test page.
- 3rd Party cookies are now additionally cleared.  All cookies are now accessible to the client in preparation for {% url `cy.clearCookies()` clearcookies %}.
- Manual navigation after tests run now works reliably.
- Navigating between full page refreshes during tests now works reliably.

**Bugfixes:**

- Server-side redirects are now completely transparently handled and supported.
- URLs are no longer altered in any weird way.
- Problematic `headers` are now automatically stripped from remote responses.
- 3rd party `headers` are now properly proxied onto all responses.
- Custom headers and other headers "of interest" are rewritten for transparent compatibility.
- `gzip` compression now handled and proxied correctly.

**Misc:**

- Completely overhauled the URL and proxy system used to serve remote applications.
- Drastically simplified the architecture required for proxying.
- Improved reliability for displaying the remote url.
- Namespaced all cypress internal routes.
- Many internal development / debugging processes improved.
- Added 100+ new tests surrounding serving remote content and processing requests.
- Renamed all remaining old references to `eclectus`.
- All responses are now streamed using `content-encoding: chunked`.
