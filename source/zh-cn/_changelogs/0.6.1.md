# 0.6.1

*Released 05/15/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- Using the `length` option in traversal commands works properly now. Fixes {% issue 38 '#38' %}.
- Command logging now works even if no `cy` commands have been issued. Fixes {% issue 37 '#37' %}.

**Misc:**

- Removed cy proxy commands: `each`, `map`. These didn't really "fit" into the concept of a command, and with {% url `.invoke()` invoke %} or {% url `.its()` its %} they're accessible anyway, so nothing is really lost.
