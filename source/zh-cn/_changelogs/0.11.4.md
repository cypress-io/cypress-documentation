# 0.11.4

*Released 09/17/2015*

**Features:**

- {% url `.should()` should %} now accepts a callback function which will be retried until it does not throw. The callback function will be retried in the exact same way as passing regular string-based chainers to {% url `.should()` should %}. Having a callback function gives you an opportunity to *massage* the expected subject such as comparing multiple elements, creating an array of text or classes, etc.

**Deprecations:**

- `cy.wait(function)` has been deprecated and you can safely rename this command to {% url `.should()` should %}.

**Misc:**

- All of the docs surrounding {% url 'assertions' introduction-to-cypress#Assertions %}, {% url `.should()` should %}, and {% url `.and()` and %} have been updated to reflect the new API.
