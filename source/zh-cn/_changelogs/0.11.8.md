# 0.11.8

*Released 09/25/2015*

**Features:**

- Added {% url `cy.request()` request %} command which can issue XHR requests. The request is generated outside of the rowser, and bypasses all CORS restrictions. Great for talking to an API for seeding, querying, building, etc.

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevented edge case with {% url `cy.fixture()` fixture %} where it would not be able to be cancelled without throwing an nhandled rejection error.
