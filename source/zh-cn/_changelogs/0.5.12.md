# 0.5.12

*Released 04/30/2015*

**Features:**

- Introduced new **command option** `length` which cues Cypress into not resolving matched elements until their length matches the option provided.

**Bugfixes:**

- `cy.respond` will not resolve until all of the queue'd XHR's have resolved.

**Misc:**

- Cypress now throws on {% url `.should()` should %} if any DOM member isn't in the DOM, except for `exist` assertions.
- Cypress now throws on `eventually.have.length` assertions. Use implicit `{length: n}` command options instead.
- Cypress overrides chai `exist` assertion to really mean: "does this subject exist in the document?"
