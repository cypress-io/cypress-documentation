# 0.14.2

*Released 03/14/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- Chaining more cy commands after using {% url `cy.wrap()` wrap %} now works. Fixes {% issue 114 '#114' %}.
- Cypress now handles events property when a DOM element is removed during a `.click()` event. As per the spec, if `mousedown` causes element removal then `mouseup` and `click` and `focus` events will not be fired. Additionally if removal happens during `mouseup` then `click` event will not be fired. Also updated the `onConsole` groups to only display and indicate the events which actually fired. Fixes {% issue 109 '#109' %}.

**Misc:**

- Removed `fa-refresh` icons next to suites and tests until this behavior has been reimplemented due to ID removal.
- Removed resetting the runnable timeout when a `page load` event resolves. This prevents an edge case where the next test may show as timed out during `cypress run`.
