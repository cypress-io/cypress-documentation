# 0.15.2

*Released 04/03/2016*

**Features:**

- The {% url 'error message when Cypress detects that a test has ended early' error-messages %} (there are still commands left in the queue) now displays a list of these commands with a much improved explanation.
- There is now a new {% url 'configuration option' configuration %}: `watchForFileChanges` that, when set to `false` in the `cypress.json`, will prevent Cypress from attempting to watch for file changes and restart your tests.
- You can now set the default {% url `reporter` configuration %} in `cypress.json` for use during `cypress run` or in CI.

**Bugfixes:**

- The {% url '`--reporter`' command-line#cypress-run %} CLI option is now working again.
- the `teamcity` reporter is now also working again.

**Misc:**

- Updated favicon + logo mark
