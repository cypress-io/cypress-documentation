# 3.1.2

*Released 11/18/2018*

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression caused in `3.1.1` where we attempted to set a property on an invalid cookie sent from a server. Fixes {% issue 2724 %}.
- Fixed Cypress not correctly aborting long running connections (such as server sent events) on proxied requests. Fixes {% issue 2612 %}.
- Fixed bug where tests were failing due to assertions causing Cypress to accidentally iterate through cross-origin iframes. If you were seeing "random" cross-origin errors, this likely fixes those issues. Fixes {% issue 2784 %}.
- Fixed incorrectly setting `charCode` and `keyCode` when using {% url `.type()` type %} on a few different special characters such as `{`. Fixes {% issue 2105 %}.
- Fixed another regression in `3.1.1` where passing `undefined` to a `setTimeout` caused Cypress to error. Fixes {% issue 2719 %}.
- Fixed a bug in node core where Cypress would not show up in `Windows` for users on `node >= 11`. Fixes {% issue 2667 %}.
- Fixed a bug with trashing assets in linux that caused recursive `.Trash` files to show up. We now have opted to actually `rm -rf` the files in linux because trashing is too inconsistent between linux distros. Fixes {% issue 2742 %}.

**Misc**

- Added type definitions for `Cypress.moment()`. Fixes {% issue 2746 %}.
- We now display better error messages in the CLI when runs exceed billing limits. Fixes {% issue 1689 %}.

**Dependency Updates**

- Removed `progress` {% issue 2733 %}.
