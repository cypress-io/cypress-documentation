# 0.17.4

*Released 09/12/2016*

**Breaking Changes:**

- Using subsequent {% url `cy.visit()` visit %}'s *in the same test* will not necessarily force a full page refresh. If all that changed was the hash of a url, then the hash changes will take affect **without** a full page refresh. This matches the behavior of a real browser. Previously {% url `cy.visit()` visit %} always forced a full page refresh and this was not correct.

**Features:**

- Using {% url `cy.visit()` visit %} now acts *exactly* how modifying the URL in a real browser works. This means that if you visit a url with a hash in it, instead of forcing a full page refresh, it will now modify the hash route as if you had manually changed it. This more accurately reflects real user behavior. Previously this was impossible to do with Cypress other than manually altering `window.location.hash`.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in `0.17.2` which caused **separate** tests that were visiting the same URL not to actually visit the new URL and eventually time out. We've updated some of our internal QA processes around this because we rarely have regressions and they are a pretty big deal. Fixes {% issue 225 '#225' %}.
- Fixed displaying `(null)` contentType when a {% url `cy.visit()` visit %} returned a `404` status code. We now only display `contentType` when one exists.
