# 0.5.14

*Released 05/06/2015*

**Features:**

- Cypress now works with JS applications that use `pushState` and `replaceState` routing (commonly known as `HTML5 History`) without having to change any application code.
- Cypress now always updates the remote URL whenever your application changes its URL through the vast variety of ways it can do this.

**Bugfixes:**

- Removed `iframe` and `link[rel=stylesheet]` elements during DOM revert.
- Server instrument now correctly displays the number of responses their corresponding routes have had.
- Spies/Stubs/Mocks instrument now correctly displays the number of calls their corresponding methods have had.
- When users navigate between pages with commands, like {% url `.click()` click %}, Cypress now correctly waits until the age has finished loading before running more commands. Previously this waited for the `unload` event, which did not fire synchronously, and ow we bind to `beforeunload` which does.  Additionally Cypress checks to ensure `beforeunload` did not return a non-undefined value.

**Misc:**

- More changes to prepare for server adapters,
