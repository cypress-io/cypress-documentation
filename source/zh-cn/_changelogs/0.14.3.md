# 0.14.3

*Released 03/20/2016*

**Features:**

- Added {% url `cy.getCookies()` getcookies %} command for easy chain-ability. Fixes {% issue 103 '#103' %}.
- Cypress now outputs its version when passed the `--version` argument
- If you are not logged in on OSX, Cypress now issues a native system notification indicating to you that Cypress is running in your tray (many users often complained they could not tell Cypress was actually running)

**Bugfixes:**

- Handle clearing cookies better when they are created on a path other than `/`. Fixes {% issue 104 '#104' %}.
- Issuing Cypress Commands inside of a Promise now works. Fixes {% issue 111 '#111' %}.
- 'Add Project' dialog is no longer lost on blur. Fixes {% issue 115 '#115' %}.
- Desktop windows that are transparent no longer lose their box shadow.

**Misc:**

- `cy.visit()` callback functions: `onBeforeLoad` and `onLoad` are now invoked with the current runnables context instead of with `cy`. This makes accessing properties in your tests much easier.
