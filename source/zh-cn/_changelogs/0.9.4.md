# 0.9.4

*Released 07/06/2015*

**Features:**

- {% url `cy.contains()` contains %}, {% url `cy.get()` get %}, and `traversal commands` will now all log out heir last known `$el` on failure. This means the `$el` will be highlight during Command Log hovering, and will display in the console on click. his should make debugging failed DOM based commands much easier. Fixes {% issue 52 '#52' %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed edge case with {% url `cy.contains()` contains %} and command options `visible` and `exist` where it would always fail ven though the matched element was in the correct state.

**Misc:**

- {% url `cy.contains()` contains %} now throws when provided the command option: `length` because it will only ever return 1 element.
