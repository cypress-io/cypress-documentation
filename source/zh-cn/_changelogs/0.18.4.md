# 0.18.4

*Released 12/28/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent {% url `cy.url()` url %} from accessing the URL during transition phase and throwing an error. Fixes {% issue 356 '#356' %}.
- Stubbed functions now serialize correctly when switching domains on a {% url `cy.visit()` visit %}. Fixes {% issue 354 '#354' %}.
- Fixed a handful of scenarios and edge cases where cookies were not properly synchronized between external requests and the browser. This led to situations where cookies were either duplicated on requests, or were not sent. Fixes {% issue 357 '#357' %} and {% issue 361 '#361' %} and {% issue 362 '#362' %}.

**Misc:**

- {% url `cy.request()` request %} now favors `baseUrl` config over remote origin when you do not pass a fully qualified URL. Fixes {% issue 360 '#360' %}.
