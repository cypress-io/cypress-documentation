# 0.8.1

*Released 06/30/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- {% url `.select()` select %} will now fire a `focus` event on the `<select>` even if the window isn't in focus.
- {% url `.click()` click %} has been upgraded to be more intelligent about firing `focus` events, and now takes into account the previously focused element.
- {% url `.type()` type %} and {% url `.clear()` clear %} will not issue `change` events or `focus` events unnecessary when chaining together multiple actions which do not change the element or cause it to lose focus. Fixes {% issue 47 '#47' %}.
