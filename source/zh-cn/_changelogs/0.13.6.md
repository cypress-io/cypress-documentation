# 0.13.6

*Released 01/09/2016*

**Features:**

- All commands now retry if the associated element is disabled until the element is no longer disabled. If the command times out a specific error message is now thrown.
- {% url `cy.server()` server %} and {% url `cy.route()` route %} now take an optional `onAbort` callback which fires anytime an XHR is aborted.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed edge case where XHR's which were already aborted were aborted a 2nd time when tests end. Cypress now only aborts currently running XHR's which have not already been aborted.
- When passing an array of aliases to {% url `cy.wait()` wait %} there was an edge case where an incorrect error message was being thrown. The incorrect values were a combination of the wrong alias, the wrong timeout value, or the wrong request or response. Now Cypress correctly provides all 3 of these values.
