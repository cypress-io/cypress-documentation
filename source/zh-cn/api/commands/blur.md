title: blur

Blur a focused element.

{% note warning %}
This element must currently be in focus. If you want to ensure an element is focused before blurring, try using {% url `.focus()` focus %} before `.blur()`.
{% endnote %}

# Syntax

```javascript
.blur()
.blur(options)
```

## Usage

**{% fa fa-check-circle green %} Correct Usage**

```javascript
cy.get('[type="email"]').type('me@email.com').blur() // Blur email input
cy.get('[tabindex="1"]').focus().blur()              // Blur el with tabindex
```

**{% fa fa-exclamation-triangle red %} Incorrect Usage**

```javascript
cy.blur('input')              // Errors, cannot be chained off 'cy'
cy.window().blur()            // Errors, 'window' does not yield DOM element
```

## Arguments

**{% fa fa-angle-right %} options**  ***(Object)***

Pass in an options object to change the default behavior of `.blur`.

Option | Default | Description
--- | --- | ---
`log` | `true` | {% usage_options log %}
`force` | `false` | Forces the action, disables checking if {% urlHash 'element is focused' Requirements %}
`timeout` | {% url `defaultCommandTimeout` configuration#Timeouts %} | {% usage_options timeout .blur %}

## Yields {% helper_icon yields %}

{% yields same_subject .blur %}

# Examples

## No Args

### Blur the comment input

```javascript
cy.get('[name="comment"]').type('Nice Product!').blur()
```

## Options

### Blur the first input

Setting `force` to `true` in the options disables checking whether the input is focusable or currently has focus.

```javascript
cy.get('input:first').blur({ force: true })
```

# Notes

## Actionability

### Blur is not an action command

`.blur()` is not implemented like other action commands, and does not follow the same rules of {% url 'waiting for actionability' interacting-with-elements %}.

`.blur()` is just a helpful command which is a simple shortcut. Normally there's no way for a user to "blur" an element. Typically the user would have to perform **another** action like clicking or tabbing to a different element. Needing to perform a separate action like this is very indirect.

Therefore it's oftentimes much easier and simpler to test the blur behavior directly with `.blur()`.

## Timeouts

### `.blur()` can time out because your browser did not receive any blur events

If you see this error, you may want to ensure that the main browser window is currently focused. This means not being focused in debugger or any other window when the command is run.

Internally Cypress does account for this, and will polyfill the blur events when necessary to replicate what the browser does. Unfortunately the browser will still behave differently when not in focus - for instance it may throttle async events. Your best bet here is to keep Cypress focused when working on a test.

# Rules

## Requirements {% helper_icon requirements %}

{% requirements blurability .blur %}

## Assertions {% helper_icon assertions %}

{% assertions wait .blur %}

## Timeouts {% helper_icon timeout %}

{% timeouts assertions .blur %}

# Command Log

***Blur a textarea after typing.***

```javascript
cy.get('[name="comment"]').focus().type('Nice Product!').blur()
```

The commands above will display in the Command Log as:

{% imgTag /img/api/blur/blur-input-command-log.png "command log for blur" %}

When clicking on the `blur` command within the command log, the console outputs the following:

{% imgTag /img/api/blur/console-showing-blur-command.png "console.log for blur" %}
