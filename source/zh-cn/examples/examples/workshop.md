We have put together contents for a 3-4 hour workshop that teaches how to test a modern web application using Cypress. The repository [cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress][workshop repo] has an example application, test exercises (with answers), speaker slides and notes, and should be a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn Cypress or teach it to others. The exercises cover the following topics (see the workshop's [README file][workshop readme] for an exact list).

- How to install and run Cypress
- How Cypress scaffolds files
- Writing and running a basic test
- Setting up video recording and screenshots on failure
- Selector Playground
- Testing XHR requests
- Using data fixtures in your tests
- Running Cypress tests on CI
- Recording Cypress tests on dashboard

We hope this testing workshop proves itself useful in teaching developers and testers good Cypress practices.
