# 0.6.12

*Released 06/09/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- When Cypress detects a `page loading` event it will now clear out the subject so the next commands cannot reference previous page DOM elements.
- {% url `.check()` check %} and {% url `.uncheck()` uncheck %} will no longer output additional error'd commands when their associated `click` fails.

**Misc:**

- {% url `.type()` type %}, {% url `.clear()` clear %}, {% url `.check()` check %}, {% url `.uncheck()` uncheck %} now all take `{force: true}` options to force the click to happen and skip additional clickable checks.
- Now when you click the giant yellow failure messages if the error is a `CypressError` instead of logging nothing it will now find the command associated to that error and display the same message as if you clicked the failed command.
