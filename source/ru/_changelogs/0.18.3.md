# 0.18.3

*Released 12/18/2016*

**Features:**

- There is now a {% url `cy.log()` log %} command for displaying an arbitrary message and args. Useful for providing context while testing and debugging long tests. Fixes {% issue 342 '#342' %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- {% url `cy.title()` title %} now uses the `document.title` property as opposed to querying for `<title>` elements in the `<head>`. Fixes {% issue 351 '#351' %} and {% issue 331 '#331' %}.
- We now exit correctly (with status of 1) in the case of headless renderer crashes. Additionally we capture these errors properly, explain what happened, and link to external error document to suggest fixes. Fixes {% issue 270 '#270' %} and {% issue 348 '#348' %}.

**Misc:**

- Improved headless performance, and added optimizations for early and often GC.
