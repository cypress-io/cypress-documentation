# 2.1.0

*Released 3/1/2018*

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent a bug with `node-sass` on OSX + Windows when local `node` version does not match bundled `node` when importing components directly in spec files. The underlying issue was because we forgot to update `Buildkite` and `Appveyor` when we upgraded `Electron` in `2.0.0`. Fixes {% issue 1387 %} and {% issue 1390 %}.

**Features:**

- The {% url 'Selector Playground' test-runner#Selector-Playground %} has been updated to automatically prefer `data-cy`, `data-test` or `data-testid` attributes when providing the unique selector for an element. Additionally it now exposes a {% url 'public API' selector-playground-api %} that you can use to control how it determines which selector to use. Fixes {% issue 1135 %}.

**Documentation Changes:**

- {% url 'Added `Selector Playground Guide`' test-runner#Selector-Playground %}
- {% url 'Added `Selector Playground API`' selector-playground-api %}
- {% url 'Updated `Best Practices`' best-practices %}
- {% url 'Updated `FAQ`' using-cypress-faq %}
