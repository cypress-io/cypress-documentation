# 0.17.7

*Released 10/12/2016*

**Features:**

- There is now a new {% url `chromeWebSecurity` configuration#Browser %} option you can set in `cypress.json` to turn off Chrome's Web Security features. We've written a brand new reference that details why and how you could use this. {% url 'Cypress Web Security' web-security %}. This option can be used for accessing `cross origin` `<iframes>` or if your application needs to test navigation across super domains. Fixes {% issue 262 '#262' %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- We now capture `cross origin` errors correctly instead of these showing as `Uncaught DOMExceptions` in the console. Fixes {% issue 261 '#261' %}.
- We no longer trash the wrong folder on OSX in-app updates (when a project is open). Sorry about this! Fixes {% issue 260 '#260' %}.
- {% url `cy.visit()` visit %} urls with domain-like segments (which weren't actually the domain) no longer cause Cypress to think you're trying to navigate to a different superdomain. Fixes {% issue 255 '#255' %}.
