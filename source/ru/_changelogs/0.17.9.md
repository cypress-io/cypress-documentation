# 0.17.9

*Released 10/22/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress now applies cookies to the browser which were cleared between redirects. Fixes {% issue 224 '#224' %}.
- Snapshots now work even when `<html>` tag has invalid attributes. Fixes {% issue 271 '#271' %}.
- Cypress no longer crashes on initial {% url `cy.visit()` visit %} when the 3rd party web server never ends the response. Fixes {% issue 272 '#272' %}.

**Misc:**

- Changed default {% url `responseTimeout` configuration#Timeouts %} from `20000` to `30000`.
- Changed default {% url `pageLoadTimeout` configuration#Timeouts %} from `30000` to `60000`.
- The internal Cypress proxy now forcibly responds to requests taking longer than `responseTimeout`. Currently this sends back `text/html` with the `ETIMEDOUT` error, but this likely needs to be configurable. The reason we are now forcibly applying timeouts is to prevent `socket pooling exhaustion` where tests are running and a 3rd party server never responds to the request.
