# 1.0.2

*Released 10/13/2017*

**Bugfixes:**

- `cy.type` now correctly fires change events on React 16. Fixes {% issue 647 %}.
- Fixed some problems serializing objects during domain change caused by circular references. In this case `zone.js` was the culprit. Fixes {% issue 741 %}. Contributed by {% user MariMax %}.

**Misc:**

- `cy.scrollTo` now logs its coordinates when options are used. Fixes {% issue 725 %}. Contributed by {% user sirugh %}.
- You can now use environment variables that have a `=` character as values. Fixes {% issue 620 %}. Contributed by {% user HugoGiraudel %}.
- There is now a new `videoUploadOnPasses` configuration option in `cypress.json`. Turning this off will only compress and upload videos on failures. This only affects projects which are setup to record to the Dashboard. Fixes {% issue 460 %}. Contributed by {% user carlos-granados %}.
