Use `cy.route()` to manage the behavior of network requests.

{% note info %}
**Note:** `cy.route()` assumes you are already familiar with core concepts such as {% url 'network requests' network-requests %}
{% endnote %}

{% partial network_stubbing_warning %}

# Syntax

```javascript
cy.route(url)
cy.route(url, response)
cy.route(method, url)
cy.route(method, url, response)
cy.route(callbackFn)
cy.route(options)
```

## Usage

**{% fa fa-check-circle green %} Correct Usage**

```javascript
cy.route('/users/**')
```

## Arguments

**{% fa fa-angle-right %} url** ***(String, Glob, RegExp)***

Listen for a route matching the specific URL.

**{% fa fa-angle-right %} response** ***(String, Object, Array)***

Supply a response `body` to *stub* in the matching route.

**{% fa fa-angle-right %} method** ***(String)***

Match the route to a specific method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc).

{% note bolt %}
If no method is defined Cypress will match `GET` requests by default.
{% endnote %}

**{% fa fa-angle-right %} callbackFn** ***(Function)***

Listen for a route matching a returned object literal from a callback function. Functions that return a `Promise` will automatically be awaited.

**{% fa fa-angle-right %} options** ***(Object)***

Pass in an options object to change the default behavior of `cy.route()`. By default `cy.route()` inherits its options from {% url `cy.server()` server %}.

Option | Default | Description
--- | --- | ---
`delay` | `0` | Delay for stubbed responses (in ms)
`force404` | `false` | Forcibly send a 404 status when the XHR does not match any existing `cy.route()`.
`headers` | `null` | Response headers for stubbed routes
`method` | `GET` | Method to match against requests
`onAbort` | `null` | Callback function which fires anytime an XHR is aborted
`onRequest` | `null` | Callback function when a request is sent
`onResponse` | `null` | Callback function when a response is returned
`response` | `null` | Response body when stubbing routes
`status` | `200` | Response status code when stubbing routes
`url`    | `null` | String or RegExp url to match against request urls

You can also set options for all {% url `cy.wait()` wait %}'s `requestTimeout` and `responseTimeout` globally in {% url 'configuration' configuration %} to control how long to wait for the request and response of a supplied route.

## Yields {% helper_icon yields %}

{% yields null_alias cy.route %}

# Examples

## Without Stubbing

If you do not pass a `response` to a route, Cypress will pass the request through without stubbing it. We can still wait for the request to resolve later.

### Wait on XHR `GET` request matching `url`

```javascript
cy.server()
cy.route('**/users').as('getUsers')
cy.visit('/users')
cy.wait('@getUsers')
```

### Wait on XHR's matching `method` and `url`

```javascript
cy.server()
cy.route('POST', '**/users').as('postUser')
cy.visit('/users')
cy.get('#first-name').type('Julius{enter}')
cy.wait('@postUser')
```

### Setup route to `POST` to login

{% note info %}
{% url "Check out our example recipe using `cy.route()` to POST for login in HTML web forms" recipes#Logging-In %}
{% endnote %}

### Wait on `url` matching glob

Under the hood Cypress uses {% url 'minimatch' https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch %} to match glob patterns of `url`.

This means you can take advantage of `*` and `**` glob support. This makes it *much* easier to route against dynamic segments without having to build up a complex `RegExp`.

We expose {% url `Cypress.minimatch` minimatch %} as a function that you can use in your console to test routes.

### Match route against any UserId

```javascript
cy.server()
cy.route('**/users/*/comments')

// https://localhost:7777/users/123/comments     <-- matches
// https://localhost:7777/users/123/comments/465 <-- does not match
```

### Use glob to match all segments

```javascript
cy.server()
cy.route('**/posts/**')

// https://localhost:7777/posts/1            <-- matches
// https://localhost:7777/posts/foo/bar/baz  <-- matches
// https://localhost:7777/posts/quuz?a=b&1=2 <-- matches
```

### Override `url` glob matching options

When we check `glob` patterns with {% url 'minimatch' https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch %}, by default Cypress uses sets `matchBase` to `true`. You can override this option in {% url `cy.server()` server %} options.

If you want to permanently override these options you could do so by setting {% url `Cypress.Server.defaults()` cypress-server %}.

```javascript
cy.server({
  urlMatchingOptions: { matchBase: false, dot: true }
})
cy.route(...)
```

## With Stubbing

If you pass a `response` to `cy.route()`, Cypress will stub the response in the request.

### `url` as a string

When passing a `string` as the `url`, the XHR's URL must match *exactly* what you've written. You'll want to use the decoded string and not include any hash encoding (ie. use `@` instead of `%40`).

```javascript
cy.server()
cy.route('https://localhost:7777/surveys/customer?email=john@doe.com', [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'john'
  }
])
```

### `url` as a RegExp

When passing a RegExp as the `url`, the XHR's url will be tested against the regular expression and will apply if it passes.

```javascript
cy.server()
cy.route(/users\/\d+/, { id: 1, name: 'Phoebe' })
```

```javascript
// Application Code
$.get('https://localhost:7777/users/1337', (data) => {
  console.log(data) // => {id: 1, name: "Phoebe"}
})
```

### Response functions

You can also use a function as a response which enables you to add logic surrounding the response.

Functions that return a `Promise` will automatically be awaited.

```javascript
const commentsResponse = (routeData) => {
  //routeData is a reference to the current route's information
  return {
    data: someOtherFunction(routeData)
  }
}

cy.route('POST', '**/comments', commentsResponse)
```

### Matching requests and routes

Any request that matches the `method` and `url` of a route will be responded to based on the configuration of that route.

{% note bolt %}
`GET` is the default HTTP method used to match routes. If you want to stub a route with another HTTP method such as `POST` then you {% urlHash 'must be explicit about the method' Arguments %}.
{% endnote %}

{% note info %}
If a request doesn't match any route then the behavior depends on the value of the `force404` option on the {% url `cy.server()` server %}:

* if `force404` is `false` (the default) then the request will {% url 'pass through to the server' network-requests#Use-Server-Responses %}.
* if `force404` is `true` then the response {% urlHash "will be a 404" Notes %}.

You can {% url 'read more about this behavior here.' server#Options %}
{% endnote %}

### Specify the method

The below example matches all `DELETE` requests to "/users" and stubs a response with an empty JSON object.

```javascript
cy.server()
cy.route('DELETE', '**/users/*', {})
```

### Making multiple requests to the same route

You can test a route multiple times with unique response objects by using {% url 'aliases' variables-and-aliases#Aliases %} and {% url '`cy.wait()`' wait %}. Each time we use `cy.wait()` for an alias, Cypress waits for the next nth matching request.

```js
cy.server()
cy.route('/beetles', []).as('getBeetles')
cy.get('#search').type('Weevil')

// wait for the first response to finish
cy.wait('@getBeetles')

// the results should be empty because we
// responded with an empty array first
cy.get('#beetle-results').should('be.empty')

// now re-define the /beetles response
cy.route('/beetles', [{ name: 'Geotrupidae' }])

cy.get('#search').type('Geotrupidae')

// now when we wait for 'getBeetles' again, Cypress will
// automatically know to wait for the 2nd response
cy.wait('@getBeetles')

// we responded with 1 beetle item so now we should
// have one result
cy.get('#beetle-results').should('have.length', 1)
```

## Fixtures

Instead of writing a response inline you can automatically connect a response with a {% url `cy.fixture()` fixture %}.

```javascript
cy.server()
cy.route('**/posts/*', 'fixture:logo.png').as('getLogo')
cy.route('**/users', 'fixture:users/all.json').as('getUsers')
cy.route('**/admin', 'fx:users/admin.json').as('getAdmin')
```

You may want to define the `cy.route()` after receiving the fixture and working with its data.

```javascript
cy.fixture('user').then((user) => {
  user.firstName = 'Jane'
  // work with the users array here

  cy.route('GET', '**/user/123', user)
})

cy.visit('/users')
cy.get('.user').should('include', 'Jane')
```

You can also reference fixtures as strings directly in the response by passing an aliased fixture with `@`.

```javascript
cy.fixture('user').as('fxUser')
cy.route('POST', '**/users', '@fxUser')
```

## Options

### Pass in an options object

```javascript
cy.server()
cy.route({
  method: 'DELETE',
  url: '**/user/*',
  status: 412,
  response: {
    rolesCount: 2
  },
  delay: 500,
  headers: {
    'X-Token': null
  },
  onRequest: (xhr) => {
    // do something with the
    // raw XHR object when the
    // request initially goes out
  },
  onResponse: (xhr) => {
    // do something with the
    // raw XHR object when the
    // response comes back
  }
})
```

### Simulate a server redirect

Below we simulate the server returning `503` with a stubbed empty JSON response body.

```javascript
cy.route({
  method: 'POST',
  url: '**/login',
  response: {
    // simulate a redirect to another page
    redirect: '/error'
  }
})
```

### Setup route to error on `POST` to login

{% note info %}
{% url "Check out our 'XHR Web Forms' example recipe using `cy.route()` to simulate a `503` on `POST` to login" recipes#Logging-In %}
{% endnote %}

### Change `headers`

By default, Cypress will automatically set `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` based on what your `response body` looks like.

If you'd like to override this, explicitly pass in `headers` as an object literal.

```javascript
cy.route({
  url: '**/user-image.png',
  response: 'fx:logo.png,binary' // binary encoding
  headers: {
    // set content-type headers
    'content-type': 'binary/octet-stream'
  }
})
```

### Use delays for responses

You can pass in a `delay` option that causes a delay (in ms) to the `response` for matched requests. The example below will cause the response to be delayed by 3 secs. This can be useful for testing loading states, like loading spinners, in the DOM before the request responds.

```javascript
cy.route({
  method: 'PATCH',
  url: '**/activities/*',
  response: {},
  delay: 3000
})
```

## Function

### Set the routing options using a callback function

```javascript
cy.route(() => {
  // ...do some custom logic here..

  // and return an appropriate routing object here
  return {
    method: 'POST',
    url: '**/users/*/comments',
    response: this.commentsFixture
  }
})
```

### Functions that return promises are awaited

```javascript
cy.route(() => {
  // a silly example of async return
  return new Cypress.Promise((resolve) => {
    // resolve this promise after 1 second
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve({
        method: 'PUT',
        url: '**/posts/**',
        response: '@postFixture'
      })
    }, 1000)
  })
})
```

# Notes

## Debugging

### Understanding stubbed vs regular XHRs

Cypress indicates whether an XHR sent back a stubbed response or actually went out to a server in its Command Log

XHRs that display `(XHR STUB)` in the Command Log have been stubbed and their response, status, headers, and delay have been controlled by your matching `cy.route()`.

XHRs that display `(XHR)` in the Command Log have *not* been stubbed and were passed directly through to a server.

{% imgTag /img/api/route/xhr-stub-versus-not-stubbed-routes-in-command-log.png "XHR Command Log when not stubbed" %}

Cypress also logs whether the XHR was stubbed or not to the console when you click on the command in the Command Log. It will indicate whether a request was stubbed, which url it matched or that it did not match any routes.

{% imgTag /img/api/route/console-log-shows-if-route-was-stubbed-also.png "XHR Command Log stubbed" %}

Even the `Initiator` is included, which is a stack trace to what caused the XHR to be sent.

## `cy.route()` cannot be debugged using {% url `cy.request()` request %}

### `cy.request()` sends requests to actual endpoints, bypassing those defined using `cy.route()`

The intention of `cy.request()` is to be used for checking endpoints on an actual, running server without having to start the front end application.

## Matches

### Matching origins and non origin URL's

When Cypress matches up an outgoing XHR request to a `cy.route()`, it actually attempts to match it against both the fully qualified URL and then additionally without the URL's origin.

```javascript
cy.route('**/users/*')
```

The following XHRs which were `xhr.open(...)` with these URLs would:

**Match:**

- `/users/1`
- `http://localhost:2020/users/2`
- `https://google.com/users/3`

**Not Match:**

- `/users/4/foo`
- `http://localhost:2020/users/5/foo`

## No matches

### Requests that don't match any routes

You can force requests that do _not_ match a route to return a `404` status and an empty body by passing an option to the `cy.server()` like so:

```javascript
cy.server({ force404: true })
```

You can {% url 'read more about this here.' server#Options %}

# Rules

## Requirements {% helper_icon requirements %}

{% requirements parent cy.route %}

## Assertions {% helper_icon assertions %}

{% assertions none cy.route %}

## Timeouts {% helper_icon timeout %}

{% timeouts none cy.route %}

# Command Log

```javascript
cy.server()
cy.route(/accounts/).as('accountsGet')
cy.route(/company/, 'fixtures:company').as('companyGet')
cy.route(/teams/,   'fixtures:teams').as('teamsGet')
```

Whenever you start a server and add routes, Cypress will display a new Instrument Log called *Routes*. It will list the routing table in the Instrument Log, including the `method`, `url`, `stubbed`, `alias` and number of matched requests:

{% imgTag /img/api/route/routing-table-displayed-in-command-log-for-cy-route.png "Command Log routing table" %}

When XHRs are made, Cypress will log them in the Command Log and indicate whether they matched a routing alias:

{% imgTag /img/api/route/some-xhr-responses-including-200-and-500-status-codes.png "Command Log XHR alias route" %}

When clicking on `XHR Stub` within the Command Log, the console outputs the following:

{% imgTag /img/api/route/console-log-shows-status-duration-response-request-and-other-data-for-routing.png "Console Log XHR alias route" %}
