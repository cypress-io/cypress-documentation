Visit a remote URL.

{% note warning 'Best Practice' %}
We recommend setting a `baseUrl` when using `cy.visit()`.

Read about {% url 'best practices' best-practices#Setting-a-global-baseUrl %} here.
{% endnote %}

# Syntax

```javascript
cy.visit(url)
cy.visit(url, options)
cy.visit(options)
```

## Usage

**{% fa fa-check-circle green %} Correct Usage**

```javascript
cy.visit('http://localhost:3000')    // Yields the window of the remote page
cy.visit('./pages/hello.html')
```

## Arguments

**{% fa fa-angle-right %} url** ***(String)***

The URL to visit.

Cypress will prefix the URL with the `baseUrl` configured in your {% url 'network options' configuration#Global %} if you've set one.

You may also specify the relative path of an html file.  The path is relative to the root
directory of the Cypress installation. Note that the `file://` prefix is not needed.

**{% fa fa-angle-right %} options** ***(Object)***

Pass in an options object to control the behavior of `cy.visit()`.

Option | Default | Description
--- | --- | ---
`url` | `null` | The URL to visit. Behaves the same as the `url` argument.
`method` | `GET` | The HTTP method to use in the visit. Can be `GET` or `POST`.
`body` | `null` | An optional body to send along with a `POST` request. If it is a string, it will be passed along unmodified. If it is an object, it will be URL encoded to a string and sent with a `Content-Type: application/x-www-urlencoded` header.
`headers` | `{}` | An object that maps HTTP header names to values to be sent along with the request. *Note:* `headers` will only be sent for the initial `cy.visit()` request, not for any subsequent requests.
`qs` | `null` | Query parameters to append to the `url` of the request
`log` | `true` | {% usage_options log %}
`auth` | `null` | Adds Basic Authorization headers
`failOnStatusCode` | `true` | Whether to fail on response codes other than `2xx` and `3xx`
`onBeforeLoad` | `function` | Called before your page has loaded all of its resources.
`onLoad` | `function` | Called once your page has fired its load event.
`retryOnStatusCodeFailure` | `false` | {% usage_options retryOnStatusCodeFailure cy.visit %}
`retryOnNetworkFailure` | `true` | {% usage_options retryOnNetworkFailure cy.visit %}
`timeout` | {% url `pageLoadTimeout` configuration#Timeouts %} | {% usage_options timeout cy.visit %}

You can also set all `cy.visit()` commands' `pageLoadTimeout` and `baseUrl` globally in {% url 'configuration' configuration %}.

## Yields {% helper_icon yields %}

{% yields sets_subject cy.visit 'yields the `window` object after the page finishes loading' %}

# Examples

## URL

### Visit a local server running on `http://localhost:8000`

`cy.visit()` resolves when the remote page fires its `load` event.

```javascript
cy.visit('http://localhost:8000')
```

## Options

### Change the default timeout

```javascript
// Wait 30 seconds for page 'load' event
cy.visit('/index.html', { timeout: 30000 })
```

### Add basic auth headers

Cypress will automatically apply the right authorization headers if you're attempting to visit an application that requires {% url 'Basic Authentication' https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication %}.

Provide the `username` and `password` in the `auth` object. Then all subsequent requests matching the origin you're testing will have these attached at the network level.

```javascript
cy.visit('https://www.acme.com/', {
  auth: {
    username: 'wile',
    password: 'coyote'
  }
})
```

You can also provide the username and password directly in the URL.

```javascript
// this is the same thing as providing the auth object
cy.visit('https://wile:coyote@www.acme.com')
```

{% note info %}
Cypress will automatically attach this header at the network proxy level, outside of the browser. Therefore you **will not** see this header in the Dev Tools.
{% endnote %}

### Provide an `onBeforeLoad` callback function

`onBeforeLoad` is called as soon as possible, before your page has loaded all of its resources. Your scripts will not be ready at this point, but it's a great hook to potentially manipulate the page.

```javascript
cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/#dashboard', {
  onBeforeLoad: (contentWindow) => {
    // contentWindow is the remote page's window object
  }
})
```

{% note info %}
Check out our example recipes using `cy.visit()`'s `onBeforeLoad` option to:
  - {% url 'Bootstraping your App' recipes#Server-Communication %}
  - {% url 'Set a token to `localStorage` for login during Single Sign On' recipes#Logging-In %}
  - {% url 'Stub `window.fetch`' recipes#Stubbing-and-spying %}
{% endnote %}

### Provide an `onLoad` callback function

`onLoad` is called once your page has fired its `load` event. All of the scripts, stylesheets, html and other resources are guaranteed to be available at this point.

```javascript
cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/#/users', {
  onLoad: (contentWindow) => {
    // contentWindow is the remote page's window object
    if (contentWindow.angular) {
      // do something
    }
  }
})
```

### Add query paramaters

You can provide query parameters as an object to `cy.visit()` by passing `qs` to `options`.

```js
// visits http://localhost:3500/users?page=1&role=admin
cy.visit('http://localhost:3500/users', {
  qs: {
    page: '1',
    role: 'admin'
  }
})
```

The parameters passed to `qs` will be merged into existing query parameters on the `url`.

```js
// visits http://example.com/users?page=1&admin=true
cy.visit('http://example.com/users?page=1', {
  qs: { admin: true }
})
```

### Submit a form

To send a request that looks like a user submitting an HTML form, use a `POST` method with a `body` containing the form values:

```javascript
cy.visit({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/cgi-bin/newsletterSignup',
  method: 'POST',
  body: {
    name: 'George P. Burdell',
    email: 'burdell@microsoft.com'
  }
})
```

# Notes

## Redirects

### Visit will automatically follow redirects

```javascript
// we aren't logged in, so our web server
// redirected us to /login
cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/admin')
cy.url().should('match', /login/)
```

## Protocol

### Protocol can be omitted from common hosts

Cypress automatically prepends the `http://` protocol to common hosts.  If you're not using one of these 3 hosts, then make sure to provide the protocol.

```javascript
cy.visit('localhost:3000') // Visits http://localhost:3000
cy.visit('0.0.0.0:3000')   // Visits http://0.0.0.0:3000
cy.visit('127.0.0.1:3000') // Visits http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

## Web Server

### Cypress can optionally act as your web server

Cypress will automatically attempt to serve your files if you don't provide a host. The path should be relative to your project's root folder (where the `cypress.json` file is generated by default).

Having Cypress serve your files is useful in smaller projects and example apps, but isn't recommended for production apps.  It is always better to run your own server and provide the url to Cypress.

```javascript
cy.visit('app/index.html')
```

## Prefixes

### Visit is automatically prefixed with `baseUrl`

Configure `baseUrl` in the your {% url 'configuration' configuration %} file (`cypress.json` by default) to prevent repeating yourself in every `cy.visit()` command.

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000/#/"
}
```

```javascript
cy.visit('dashboard') // Visits http://localhost:3000/#/dashboard
```

## Window

### Visit will always yield the remote page's `window` object when it resolves

```javascript
cy.visit('index.html').then((contentWindow) => {
  // contentWindow is the remote page's window object
})
```

## User agent

Trying to change the `User-Agent`? You can set the `userAgent` as a {% url "configuration value" configuration#Browser %} in your configuration file.

## Routing

### Prevent XHR / Ajax requests before a remote page initially loads

One common scenario Cypress supports is visiting a remote page and also preventing any Ajax requests from immediately going out.

You may think this works:

```javascript
// this code may not work depending on implementation
cy.visit('http://localhost:8000/#/app')
cy.server()
cy.route('/users/**', 'fx:users')
```

But if your app makes a request upon being initialized, *the above code will not work*. `cy.visit()` will resolve once its `load` event fires.  The {% url `cy.server()` server %} and {% url `cy.route()` route %} commands are not processed until *after* `cy.visit()` resolves.

Many applications will have already begun routing, initialization, and requests by the time the `cy.visit()` in the above code resolves. Therefore creating a {% url `cy.server()` server %} will happen too late, and Cypress will not process the requests.

Luckily Cypress supports this use case. Reverse the order of the commands:

```javascript
// this code is probably what you want
cy.server()
cy.route('/users/**', {...})
cy.visit('http://localhost:8000/#/app')
```

Cypress will automatically apply the server and routes to the very next `cy.visit()` and does so immediately before any of your application code runs.

# Command Log

***Visit example application in a `beforeEach`***

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io/commands/viewport')
})
```

The commands above will display in the Command Log as:

{% imgTag /img/api/visit/visit-example-page-in-before-each-of-test.png "Command Log visit" %}

When clicking on `visit` within the command log, the console outputs the following:

{% imgTag /img/api/visit/visit-shows-any-redirect-or-cookies-set-in-the-console.png "console Log visit" %}
