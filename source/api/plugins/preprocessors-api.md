title: Preprocessors API
---

A preprocessor is the plugin responsible for preparing a {% url "support file" writing-and-organizing-tests#Support-file %} or a {% url "test file" writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-files %} for the browser.

A preprocessor could transpile your file from another language (CoffeeScript or ClojureScript) or from a newer version of JavaScript (ES2017).

A preprocessor also typically watches the source files for changes, processes them again, and then notifies Cypress to re-run the tests.

# Examples

We've created three preprocessors as examples for you to look at. These are fully functioning preprocessors.

The code contains comments that explain how it utilizes the preprocessor API.

* {% url 'webpack preprocessor' https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-webpack-preprocessor %}
* {% url 'Browserify preprocessor' https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-browserify-preprocessor %}
* {% url 'Watch preprocessor' https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-watch-preprocessor %}

# Defaults

By default, Cypress comes packaged with the **webpack preprocessor** already installed.

The webpack preprocessor handles:

- ES2015 and JSX via Babel
- TypeScript
- CoffeeScript `1.x.x`
- Watching and caching files

{% note info %}
Are you looking to change the **default options** for webpack?
{% endnote %}

If you already use webpack in your project, you can pass in your webpack config as {% url 'shown here' https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-webpack-preprocessor#options %}.

If you don't use webpack in your project or would like to keep the majority of the default options, you can {% url 'modify the default options' https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-webpack-preprocessor#modifying-default-options %}. Editing the options allows you to do things like:

- Add your own Babel plugins
- Modify options for TypeScript compilation
- Add support for CoffeeScript `2.x.x`

# Usage

To use a preprocessor, you should bind to the `file:preprocessor` event in your {% url "`pluginsFile`" configuration#Folders-Files %}:

```javascript
// plugins file
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('file:preprocessor', (file) => {
    // ...
  })
}
```

## The callback function should return one of the following:

* A promise\* that eventually resolves the path to the **built file**\*\*.
* A promise\* that eventually rejects with an error that occurred during processing.

> \* The promise should resolve only after the file has completed writing to disk. The promise resolving is a signal that the file is ready to be served to the browser.

---

> \*\* The built file is the file that is created by the preprocessor that will eventually be served to the browser.

> If, for example, the source file is `spec.coffee`, the preprocessor should:
1. Compile the CoffeeScript into JavaScript `spec.js`
2. Write that JavaScript file to disk (example: `/Users/foo/tmp/spec.js`)
3. Resolve with the absolute path to that file: `/Users/foo/tmp/spec.js`

{% note warning %}
This callback function can and *will* be called multiple times with the same `filePath`.

The callback function is called any time a file is requested by the browser. This happens on each run of the tests.

Make sure not to start a new watcher each time it is called. Instead, cache the watcher and, on subsequent calls, return a promise that resolves when the latest version of the file has been processed.
{% endnote %}

# File object

The `file` object passed to the callback function has the following properties:

Property | Description
-------- | ----------
`filePath` | The full path to the source file.
`outputPath` | The suggested path for saving the preprocessed file to disk. This is unique to the source file. A preprocessor can choose to write the file elsewhere, but Cypress automatically provides you this value as a convenient default.
`shouldWatch` | A boolean indicating whether the preprocessor should watch for file changes or not.

# File events

The `file` object passed to the callback function is an {% url "Event Emitter" https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter %}.

## Receiving 'close' event

When the running spec, the project, or the browser is closed while running tests, the `close` event will be emitted. The preprocessor should do any necessary cleanup in this function, like closing the watcher when watching.

```javascript
// example
const watcher = fs.watch(filePath, /* ... */)

file.on('close', () => {
  watcher.close()
})
```

## Sending 'rerun' event

If watching for file changes, emit `rerun` after a file has finished being processed to let Cypress know to rerun the tests.

```javascript
// example
fs.watch(filePath, () => {
  file.emit('rerun')
})
```

# Publishing

Publish preprocessors to {% url "npm" https://www.npmjs.com/ %} with the naming convention `cypress-*-preprocessor` (e.g. cypress-clojurescript-preprocessor).

Use the following npm keywords:

```json
"keywords": [
  "cypress",
  "cypress-plugin",
  "cypress-preprocessor"
]
```

Feel free to submit your published plugins to our {% url "list of plugins" plugins %}.
