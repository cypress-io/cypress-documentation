# 0.6.5

*Released 05/23/2015*

**Features:**

- When Cypress detects a regular HTTP page loading event (where we're leaving the current page and requesting a new one) it will now insert a `loading` command which indicates to the user Cypress has stopped running commands until the new page loads.
- If for some reason this new page errors Cypress will display the initial 500 error messages just like {% url `cy.visit()` visit %}.
- Cypress now waits `20s` (which matches {% url `cy.visit()` visit %}) for the new page to load instead of `4s` previously.

**Bugfixes:**

- {% url `.submit()` submit %} will actually submit the form for real now, instead of just firing the submit event. Now it's been upgraded to be able to be cancelled or have its returnValue set to false and will not submit the form. Don't ask how I missed this one. I as once a young naive programmer who trusted the DOM not to be the abomination it actually is.

**Misc:**

- No longer send back a 500 message when initial response status code is 4xx.
