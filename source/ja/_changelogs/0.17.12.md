# 0.17.12

*Released 11/21/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- You no longer have to log in again after updating. Fixes {% issue 305 '#305' %}.
- Updating in app now works again. Sorry about that. Fixes {% issue 304 '#304' %}.
- Headless frame rate is now correctly set to `20` instead of resetting back to `60`. Fixes {% issue 303 '#303' %}.
- We now automatically drop frames that the CPU cannot keep up with while video recording during `cypress run`. Previously we would buffer all frames in memory and it was possible to exhaust all memory due to the way that streaming backpressure works. Fixes {% issue 302 '#302' %}.
- Fixed an edge case in the `driver` that could lead to memory leaks. This happened when Command Logs updated from previously run tests. Normally, in headless mode, we automatically remove references to purge memory after each test, but when logs were updated after this, their references were merged back in again and held onto forever. If you were seeing long Cypress runs die or eventually halt, this was likely the cause. We did extensive memory regression analysis on Cypress and could not find any more memory leaks. Fixes {% issue 301 '#301' %}.

**Misc:**

- Improved {% url '`cypress run`' command-line#cypress-run %} and `cypress ci` headless output. Fixes {% issue 306 '#306' %}.
- Improved performance by preventing `snapshots` from being taken during headless runs.
