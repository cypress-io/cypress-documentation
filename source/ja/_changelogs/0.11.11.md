# 0.11.11

*Released 10/04/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- Snapshots of {% url `.type()` type %} and {% url `.select()` select %} are no longer incorrect due to taking snapshots too early. Fixes {% issue 22 '#22' %}.
- Passing `{force: true}` to {% url `.blur()` blur %} now logs correctly in the Command Log.

**Misc:**

- Added delays on some tooltips.
- The URL will now highlight in a yellow background during a revert DOM snapshot.
- Moved snapshot message to be affixed to the bottom of the remote app in preparation for cycling through multiple snapshots.
- Cleaned up the URL by removing some unused content.
