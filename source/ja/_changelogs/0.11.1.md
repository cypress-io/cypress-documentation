# 0.11.1

*Released 09/14/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- Utilizing {% url `cy.server()` server %} across multiple tests before a {% url `cy.visit()` visit %} now works correctly. As a side effect now Cypress will rebind both the `server` and all `routes` **whenever** the remote window is reloaded (for whatever reason) - even during a test itself. This means you can navigate between pages without ever having to restart the server or routes (they will automatically rebind) when the window loads. Fixes {% issue 59 '#59' %}.

**Misc:**

- Providing a "number-string" as in: `should("have.length", "1")` will no longer throw an error.
- Internal API changes for `$Commands`.
