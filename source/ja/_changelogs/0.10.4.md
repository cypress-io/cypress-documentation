# 0.10.4

*Released 08/11/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- The OSX Cypress App was not being properly signed (since 0.10.0) due to an oversight in our deployment process. This has been fixed now and additional checks have been added to ensure the deployed version is properly signed. Updating within the app was unaffected. This bug only effected fresh downloads from the internet.
- Errors / crashes encountered when updating to newer versions through the app should be fixed now.
