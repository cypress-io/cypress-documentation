# 0.5.10

*Released 04/28/2015*

**Features:**

- {% url `cy.server()` server %} now accepts a `delay` option which will delay all responses to requests (including 404) based on the value in ms
- {% url `cy.server()` server %} now accepts a `respond` option which can turn off automatic responding to requests.
- {% url `cy.route()` route %} now accepts a `delay` option which overrides the delay option set in {% url `cy.server()` server %} to just matched requests.
- {% url `cy.route()` route %} now accepts a `respond` option which will turn off automatic responding to just matched requests.
- Fixes {% issue 14 '#14' %}.
- {% url `cy.wait()` wait %} now accepts an alias property called `request`. Example: `cy.wait('@getUsers.request')` which ill resolve once the XHR is initially requested, before it is responded to.  This allows you to test things when a request is in flight.
- Added `cy.respond` command which will respond to all pending requests when `{respond: false}` is set in the `server` or `route`.
- {% url `.debug()` debug %} now displays pending requests and completed requests.
- The command UI now displays pending requests as a `pending command`.

**Misc:**

- Updated `sinon` to `1.14.1`.
