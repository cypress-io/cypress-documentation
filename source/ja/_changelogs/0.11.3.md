# 0.11.3

*Released 09/16/2015*

**Features:**

- When XHR's are aborted Cypress will display the stack trace indicating where in your app the XHR was aborted. Additionally it will display as `(aborted)` in the Command Log.

**Bugfixes:**

- XHR's will no longer be ended early and display no status as if there was no response. Fixes {% issue 63 '#63' %}.
- XHR's which are aborted no longer cause an `INVALID_STATE_ERR` to be thrown. Fixes {% issue 62 '#62' %} and {% issue 34 '#34' %}.
- Cypress will no longer incorrectly revert to a previous test run's snapshot when tests are re-run.
