# 0.13.7

*Released 01/17/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent error during element stringification on `<svg>`. Fixes {% issue 93 '#93' %}.
- Clarified on errors related to not being able to run in CI. Previously there was a "catch all" error indicating your Cypress API Key was invalid. This was oftentimes incorrect. More specific errors have been added.
- {% url `.type()` type %} has been upgraded to handle current selection ranges. Previously if an `<input>` had a selection range as Cypress began to type, this would be ignored. Cypress now takes this into account and will type over any selected text (as native typing would do).

**Misc:**

- All Cypress related services have been updated to use HTTPS. We are forcing HTTPS redirects for everything except for `api.cypress.io`, which would be a breaking change. By the next minor release we will force that as well. Once we make this change we will remove all versions below `0.13.7`. So make sure you **are not** locking the Cypress version when running in CI. We periodically remove old Cypress versions which have security flaws and this is an example of one.
