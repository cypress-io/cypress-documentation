# 0.12.2

*Released 11/01/2015*

**Features:**

- There is now a `cy.cmd` and `cy.command` method which enables you to invoke commands by their string name. This is most useful when using *namespaced* custom commands. So `Cypress.addParentCommand("dashboard.setSlider", ...)` can be accessed by `cy.cmd("dashboard.setSlider", arg1, arg2)`. (Docs have not been written yet).
- `Environment Variable` support has been added and can be accessed in your tests with {% url `Cypress.env` env %}. The docs have been written {% url 'Environment Variable' environment-variables %} and {% url 'here' env %}.

**Misc:**

- The URL property on all XHR's is now completely decoded, even on URL's which were originally encoded. The reason is for easier assertions and debugging. This URL property is specific to Cypress and does not actually affect the underlying XHR.
