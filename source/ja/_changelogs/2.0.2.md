# 2.0.2

*Released 2/17/2018*

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed more edge cases where legitimate JavaScript code was being modified unexpectedly by the {% url "`modifyObstructiveCode`" configuration#Browser %} configuration. We've tightened up the RegExp even more and added 40 popular JS libraries to test against to ensure they are not modified. Fixes {% issue 1334 %}.
- Fixed an edge case when hooks such as `beforeEach` or `afterEach` threw an **identical** error message, Cypress would hang indefinitely and never finish running the tests. Fixes {% issue 674 %}.
- Fixed bug when `Errors` that threw with no arguments: `throw new Error()` and had their messages appended would duplicate the message over and over again. Fixes {% issue 1338 %}.
