# 0.13.3

*Released 12/25/2015*

**Notes:**

- Merry Christmas everyone ;-)

**Features:**

- Overhauled the entire subsystem dealing with an element's visibility state. Previously we were using jQuery's `.is(":visible")` selector which was ineffective at truly determining when an element is "visible". Our changes now differ significantly from jQuery, but they match what a real user would consider visible, and the rules are fairly easy to explain. In other words these rules should just "make sense".
- An element is considered visible if it can be "interactive" with a user. In other words, if the user is able to click, type, drag, or otherwise physically interact with the element it is considered visible.
- Because of the additional complexities of how Cypress considers an element `visible`, we now have added the **exact** reason why an element is not visible when throwing an error. This means you'll see errors detailing whether an element or its parents have `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, or whether an element is considered hidden because its effective `width` or `height` is zero. Whatever the reason, Cypress will indicate why your element is considered hidden.
- Exposed `Cypress.Dom.isHidden` which holds the logic for determining an element's visibility. Modify this to change the rules.
- Upgraded {% url `.select()` select %} to automatically retry when the `<select>` is disabled, its matching `<option>` is disabled, or when Cypress cannot find a matching `<option>`. This more correctly aligns with the behavior of other actions like {% url `.click()` click %}, which automatically retry until the element is ready to receive the action.

**Bugfixes:**

- Throw on {% url `.select()` select %} when it cannot find a matching `<option>`. Also throw when `<select>` or a matching `<option>` is disabled. Fixes {% issue 91 '#91' %}.
- "Hidden" elements which actually displace height or width are now highlighted when restoring the DOM when a command is hovered.
- Margin on zero client width / client height is now displayed correctly on command hover and more accurately mimics the way Chrome Dev Tools highlights elements.
- Using `history.back`, `history.forward`, or `history.go` in CI or in headless mode now works again.

**Misc:**

- The updated hidden rules apply to all assertions like `should("be.hidden")`, and how Cypress indicates an element is hidden displays in the Command Log.
- Updated many error messages to be more explanatory and precise.
- Elements which are stringified during errors now indicate their text content (truncated to 10 characters) `<button>Save</button>` or whether they contain children elements by indicating an ellipsis `<div>...</div>`.
- The {% url 'Routes instrument panel' route %} now displays the column: `Stubbed` instead of `Status`, which indicates whether a route is stubbing matching XHR's.
