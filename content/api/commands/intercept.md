title: intercept
---

Use `cy.intercept()` to manage the behavior of HTTP requests at the network layer.

With `cy.intercept()`, you can:

- stub or spy on any type of HTTP request.
  - If `cy.intercept()` provides a response object, or a fixture, or calls `req.reply()` then the request will NOT go to the server, and instead will be mocked from the test.
  - Otherwise the request will go out to the server, and the test spies on the network call. The spying intercept can even modify the real response from the server before it is returned to the web application under test.
- [modify an HTTP request's body, headers, and URL](#Intercepting-a-request) before it is sent to the destination server.
- stub the response to an HTTP request, either dynamically or statically.
- [modify real HTTP responses](#Intercepting-a-response), changing the body, headers, or HTTP status code before they are received by the browser.
- and much more - `cy.intercept()` gives full access to all HTTP requests at all stages.

## Comparison to `cy.route()`

Unlike [cy.route()](/api/commands/route), `cy.intercept()`:

- can intercept all types of network requests including Fetch API, page loads, XMLHttpRequests, resource loads, etc.
- does not require calling [cy.server()](/api/commands/server) before use - in fact, `cy.server()` does not influence `cy.intercept()` at all.
- does not have method set to `GET` by default, but intercepts `*` methods.

## Usage

```ts
cy.intercept(url, routeHandler?)
cy.intercept(method, url, routeHandler?)
cy.intercept(routeMatcher, routeHandler?)
cy.intercept(url, routeMatcher, routeHandler)
```

**Note:** all intercepts are automatically cleared before every test.

### Arguments

#### **<Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> url** **_(`string | RegExp`)_**

Specify the URL to match. See the examples for [Matching URL](#Matching-URL) to see how URLs are matched.

```ts
cy.intercept('http://example.com/widgets')
cy.intercept('http://example.com/widgets', { fixture: 'widgets.json' })
```

#### **<Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> method** **_(`string`)_**

Specify the HTTP method to match on.

```ts
cy.intercept('POST', 'http://example.com/widgets', {
  statusCode: 200,
  body: 'it worked!',
})
```

#### **<Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> routeMatcher** **_(`RouteMatcher`)_**

`routeMatcher` is an object used to match which incoming HTTP requests will be handled by this route.

All properties are optional. All properties that are set must match for the route to handle a request. If a `string` is passed to any property, it will be glob-matched against the request using [`minimatch`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch).The available `routeMatcher` properties are listed below:

```ts
{
  /**
   * Match against the username and password used in HTTP Basic authentication.
   */
  auth?: { username: string | RegExp, password: string | RegExp }
  /**
   * Match against HTTP headers on the request.
   */
  headers?: {
    [name: string]: string | RegExp
  }
  /**
   * Match against the requested HTTP hostname.
   */
  hostname?: string | RegExp
  /**
   * If 'true', only HTTPS requests will be matched.
   * If 'false', only HTTP requests will be matched.
   */
  https?: boolean
  /**
   * Match against the request's HTTP method.
   * @default '*'
   */
  method?: string | RegExp
  /**
   * If `true`, this will pass the request on to the next `RouteMatcher` after the request handler completes.
   * Can only be used with a dynamic request handler.
   * @default false
   */
  middleware?: boolean
  /**
   * Match on request path after the hostname, including query params.
   */
  path?: string | RegExp
  /**
   * Matches like 'path', but without query params.
   */
  pathname?: string | RegExp
  /**
   * Match based on requested port, or pass an array of ports
   * to match against any in that array.
   */
  port?: number | number[]
  /**
   * Match on parsed querystring parameters.
   */
  query?: {
    [key: string]: string | RegExp
  }
  /**
   * If set, this `RouteMatcher` will only match the first `times` requests.
   */
  times?: number
  /**
   * Match against the full request URL.
   */
  url?: string | RegExp
}
```

`routeMatcher` usage examples:

```ts
cy.intercept({
  pathname: '/search',
  query: {
    q: 'some terms',
  },
}).as('searchForTerms')
// this 'cy.wait' will only resolve once a request is made to '/search'
// with the query paramater 'q=some+terms'
cy.wait('@searchForTerms')

cy.intercept(
  {
    // this RegExp matches any URL beginning with 'http://api.example.com/widgets'
    url: /^http:\/\/api\.example\.com\/widgets/,
    headers: {
      'x-requested-with': 'exampleClient',
    },
  },
  (req) => {
    // only requests to URLs starting with 'http://api.example.com/widgets'
    // having the header 'x-requested-with: exampleClient' will be received
  }
})

// in this example, the supplied URL `/users` is merged with the RouteMatcher
// passed as the second argument
cy.intercept('/users', { middleware: true }, (req) => {
  req.headers['authorization'] = `Bearer ${bearerToken}`
})

// this example will cause 1 request to `/temporary-error` to receive a network
// error. subsequent requests will not match this RouteMatcher.
cy.intercept('/temporary-error', { times: 1 }, { forceNetworkError: true })
```

#### <Icon name="angle-right"></Icon> routeHandler (<code>string | object | Function | [StaticResponse][staticresponse]</code>)

The `routeHandler` defines what will happen with a request if the [routeMatcher](#routeMatcher-RouteMatcher) matches. It can be used to [statically define a response](#Stubbing-a-response) for matching requests, or a function can be passed to [dynamically intercept the outgoing request](#Intercepting-a-request).

- If a **string** is passed, requests to the route will be fulfilled with that string as the body. Passing `"foo"` is equivalent to using a [`StaticResponse`][staticresponse] object with `{ body: "foo" }`.
- If a **[`StaticResponse`][staticresponse] object** is passed, requests to the route will be fulfilled with a response using the values supplied in the `StaticResponse`. A `StaticResponse` can define the body of the response, as well as the headers, HTTP status code, and more. See [Stubbing a response with a `StaticResponse` object](#With-a-StaticResponse-object) for an example of how this is used.
- If an **object with no [`StaticResponse`][staticresponse] keys** is passed, it will be sent as a JSON response body. For example, passing `{ foo: 'bar' }` is equivalent to passing `{ body: { foo: 'bar' } }`.
- If a **callback** is passed, it will be called whenever a request matching this route is received, with the first parameter being the request object. From inside the callback, you can modify the outgoing request, send a response, access the real response, and much more. See ["Intercepted requests"][req] for more information.

### Yields [<Icon name="question-circle"/>](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Subject-Management)

- `cy.intercept()` yields `null`.
- `cy.intercept()` can be aliased, but otherwise cannot be chained further.
- Waiting on an aliased `cy.intercept()` route using [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait) will yield an object that contains information about the matching request/response cycle. See [Using the yielded object](#Using-the-yielded-object) for examples of how to use this object.

## Examples

### Matching URL

You can provide the entire URL to match

```js
// will match any request that exactly matches the URL
//   matches GET https://prod.cypress.io/users
//   won't match GET https://staging.cypress.io/users
cy.intercept('https://prod.cypress.io/users')
```

You can provide a [`minimatch`](/api/utilities/minimatch) pattern

```javascript
// will match any HTTP method to urls that end with 3 or 5
cy.intercept('**/users?_limit=+(3|5)')
```

**Tip:** you can evaluate your URL using DevTools console to see if the [`minimatch` pattern](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch) is correct.

```javascript
// paste into the DevTools console while Cypress is running
Cypress.minimatch(
  'https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/users?_limit=3',
  '**/users?_limit=+(3|5)'
) // true

// print verbose debug information
Cypress.minimatch(
  'https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/users?_limit=3',
  '**/users?_limit=+(3|5)',
  { debug: true }
) // true + lots of debug messages
```

You can even add an assertion to the test itself to ensure the URL is matched

```javascript
// arguments are url and the pattern
expect(
  Cypress.minimatch(
    'https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/users?_limit=3',
    '**/users?_limit=+(3|5)'
  ),
  'Minimatch test'
).to.be.true
```

For the most powerful matching, provide a regular expression

```javascript
cy.intercept(/\/users\?_limit=(3|5)$/).as('users')
cy.get('#load-users').click()
cy.wait('@users').its('response.body').should('have.length', 3)

// intercepts _limit=5 requests
cy.get('#load-five-users').click()
cy.wait('@users').its('response.body').should('have.length', 5)
```

### Waiting on a request

Use [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait) with `cy.intercept()` aliases to wait for the request/response cycle to complete.

#### With URL

```js
cy.intercept('http://example.com/settings').as('getSettings')
// once a request to http://example.com/settings responds, this 'cy.wait' will resolve
cy.wait('@getSettings')
```

#### With [RouteMatcher](#routeMatcher-RouteMatcher)

```js
cy.intercept({
  url: 'http://example.com/search*',
  query: { q: 'expected terms' },
}).as('search')

// once any type of request to http://example.com/search with a querystring containing
// 'q=expected+terms' responds, this 'cy.wait' will resolve
cy.wait('@search')
```

#### Using the yielded object

Using [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait) on a `cy.intercept()` route alias yields an interception object which represents the request/response cycle:

```js
cy.wait('@someRoute').then((interception) => {
  // 'interception' is an object with properties 'id', 'request' and 'response'
})
```

You can chain [`.its()`](/api/commands/its) and [`.should()`](/api/commands/should) to assert against request/response cycles:

```js
// assert that a request to this route was made with a body that included 'user'
cy.wait('@someRoute').its('request.body').should('include', 'user')

// assert that a request to this route received a response with HTTP status 500
cy.wait('@someRoute').its('response.statusCode').should('eq', 500)

// assert that a request to this route received a response body that includes 'id'
cy.wait('@someRoute').its('response.body').should('include', 'id')
```

#### Aliasing individual requests

Aliases can be set on a per-request basis by setting the `alias` property of the intercepted request:

```js
cy.intercept('POST', '/graphql', (req) => {
  if (req.body.hasOwnProperty('query') && req.body.query.includes('mutation')) {
    req.alias = 'gqlMutation'
  }
})

// assert that a matching request has been made
cy.wait('@gqlMutation')
```

#### Aliasing individual GraphQL requests

Aliases can be set on a per-request basis by setting the `alias` property of the intercepted request.

This is useful against GraphQL endpoints to wait for specific Queries and Mutations.

Given that the `operationName` property is optional in GraphQL requests, we can `alias` with or without this property.

With `operationName` property:

```js
cy.intercept('POST', '/graphql', (req) => {
  if (req.body.operationName.includes('ListPosts')) {
    req.alias = 'gqlListPostsQuery'
  }
})

// assert that a matching request for the ListPosts Query has been made
cy.wait('@gqlListPostsQuery')
```

```js
cy.intercept('POST', '/graphql', (req) => {
  if (req.body.operationName.includes('CreatePost')) {
    req.alias = 'gqlCreatePostMutation'
  }
})

// assert that a matching request for the CreatePost Mutation has been made
cy.wait('@gqlCreatePostMutation')
```

Without `operationName` property:

```js
cy.intercept('POST', '/graphql', (req) => {
  const { body } = req

  if (body.hasOwnProperty('query') && body.query.includes('ListPosts')) {
    req.alias = 'gqlListPostsQuery'
  }
})

// assert that a matching request for the ListPosts Query has been made
cy.wait('@gqlListPostsQuery')
```

```js
cy.intercept('POST', '/graphql', (req) => {
  const { body } = req

  if (body.hasOwnProperty('query') && body.query.includes('CreatePost')) {
    req.alias = 'gqlCreatePostMutation'
  }
})

// assert that a matching request for the CreatePost Mutation has been made
cy.wait('@gqlCreatePostMutation')
```

#### Waiting on errors

You can use [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait) to wait on requests that end with network errors:

```js
cy.intercept('GET', '/should-err', { forceNetworkError: true }).as('err')

// assert that this request happened, and that it ended in an error
cy.wait('@err').should('have.property', 'error')
```

### Stubbing a response

#### With a string

```js
// requests to '/update' will be fulfilled with a body of "success"
cy.intercept('/update', 'success')
```

#### With a fixture

```js
// requests to '/users.json' will be fulfilled
// with the contents of the "users.json" fixture
cy.intercept('/users.json', { fixture: 'users.json' })
```

#### With a `StaticResponse` object

A [`StaticResponse`][staticresponse] object represents a response to an HTTP request, and can be used to stub routes:

```js
const staticResponse = {
  /* some StaticResponse properties here... */
}

cy.intercept('/projects', staticResponse)
```

For example, to stub a response with a JSON body:

```js
cy.intercept('/projects', {
  body: [{ projectId: '1' }, { projectId: '2' }],
})
```

Or to stub headers, status code, and body all at once:

```js
cy.intercept('/not-found', {
  statusCode: 404,
  body: '404 Not Found!',
  headers: {
    'x-not-found': 'true',
  },
})
```

See ["`StaticResponse` objects"][staticresponse] for more information on `StaticResponse`s.

### Intercepting a request

#### Asserting on a request

```js
cy.intercept('POST', '/organization', (req) => {
  expect(req.body).to.include('Acme Company')
})
```

#### Modifying an outgoing request

You can use the request handler callback to modify the request before it is sent.

```js
cy.intercept('POST', '/login', (req) => {
  // set the request body to something different before it's sent to the destination
  req.body = 'username=janelane&password=secret123'
})
```

#### Adding a header to an outgoing request

You can add a header to an outgoing request, or modify an existing header

```js
cy.intercept('/req-headers', (req) => {
  req.headers['x-custom-headers'] = 'added by cy.intercept'
})
```

**Note:** the new header will NOT be shown in the browser's Network tab, as the request has already left the browser. You can still confirm the header was added by waiting on the intercept as shown below:

```js
cy.intercept('/req-headers', (req) => {
  req.headers['x-custom-headers'] = 'added by cy.intercept'
}).as('headers')

// the application makes the call ...
// confirm the custom header was added
cy.wait('@headers')
  .its('request.headers')
  .should('have.property', 'x-custom-headers', 'added by cy.intercept')
```

#### Add, modify or delete a header to all outgoing requests

You can add, modify or delete a header to all outgoing requests using a `beforeEach()` in the `cypress/support/index.js` file

```ts
// Code from Real World App (RWA)
// cypress/support/index.ts
import './commands'

beforeEach(() => {
  cy.intercept(
    { url: 'http://localhost:3001/**', middleware: true },
    // Delete 'if-none-match' header from all outgoing requests
    (req) => delete req.headers['if-none-match']
  )
})
```

</Alert>

#### Dynamically stubbing a response

You can use the [`req.reply()`][req-reply] function to dynamically control the response to a request.

```js
cy.intercept('/billing', (req) => {
  // functions on 'req' can be used to dynamically respond to a request here

  // send the request to the destination server
  req.reply()

  // respond to the request with a JSON object
  req.reply({ plan: 'starter' })

  // send the request to the destination server, and intercept the response
  req.continue((res) => {
    // 'res' represents the real destination's response
    // See "Intercepting a response" for more details and examples
  })
})
```

See ["Intercepted requests"][req] for more information on the `req` object and its properties and methods.

#### Returning a Promise

If a Promise is returned from the route callback, it will be awaited before continuing with the request.

```js
cy.intercept('POST', '/login', (req) => {
  // you could asynchronously fetch test data...
  return getLoginCredentials().then((credentials) => {
    // ...and then, use it to supplement the outgoing request
    req.headers['authorization'] = credentials
  })
})
```

#### Passing a request to the next request handler

If [`req.reply()`][req-reply] or [`req.continue()`][req-continue] is not explicitly called inside of a request handler, requests will pass to the next request handler until none are left.

```js
// you could have a top-level middleware handler that sets an auth token on all requests
// setting `middleware: true` will cause this to always be called first
cy.intercept('http://api.company.com/', { middleware: true }, (req) => {
  req.headers['authorization'] = `token ${token}`
})

// and then have another handler that more narrowly asserts on certain requests
cy.intercept('POST', 'http://api.company.com/widgets', (req) => {
  expect(req.body).to.include('analytics')
})

// a POST request to http://api.company.com/widgets would hit both
// of those callbacks, middleware first, then the request would be sent out
// with the modified request headers to the real destination
```

### Intercepting a response

Inside of a callback passed to `req.continue()`, you can access the destination server's real response.

```js
cy.intercept('/integrations', (req) => {
  // req.continue() with a callback will send the request to the destination server
  req.continue((res) => {
    // 'res' represents the real destination response
    // you can manipulate 'res' before it's sent to the browser
  })
})
```

See ["Intercepted responses"][res] for more information on the `res` object. See ["Controlling the outbound request with `req.continue()`"][req-continue] for more information about `req.continue()`.

#### Asserting on a response

```js
cy.intercept('/projects/2', (req) => {
  req.continue((res) => {
    expect(res.body).to.include('My Project')
  })
})
```

#### Returning a Promise

If a Promise is returned from the route callback, it will be awaited before sending the response to the browser.

```js
cy.intercept('/users', (req) => {
  req.continue((res) => {
    // the response will not be sent to the browser until 'waitForSomething()' resolves
    return waitForSomething()
  })
})
```

#### Throttle or delay response all incoming responses

You can throttle or delay all incoming responses using a `beforeEach()` in the `cypress/support/index.js` file

```ts
// Code from Real World App (RWA)
// cypress/support/index.ts
import { isMobile } from './utils'
import './commands'
// Throttle API responses for mobile testing to simulate real world conditions
if (isMobile()) {
  cy.intercept({ url: 'http://localhost:3001/**', middleware: true }, (req) => {
    req.on('response', (res) => {
      // Throttle the response to 1 Mbps to simulate a mobile 3G connection
      res.setThrottle(1000)
    })
  })
}
```

</Alert>

## Intercepted requests

If a function is passed as the handler for a `cy.intercept()`, it will be called with the first argument being an object that represents the intercepted HTTP request:

```js
cy.intercept('/api', (req) => {
  // `req` represents the intercepted HTTP request
})
```

From here, you can do several things with the intercepted request:

- you can modify and assert on the request's properties (body, headers, URL, method...)
- the request can be sent to the real upstream server
  - optionally, you can intercept the response from this
- a response can be provided to stub out the request
- listeners can be attached to various events on the request

### Request object properties

The request object (`req`) has several properties from the HTTP request itself. All of the following properties on `req` can be modified except for `httpVersion`:

```ts
{
  /**
   * The body of the request.
   * If a JSON Content-Type was used and the body was valid JSON, this will be an object.
   * If the body was binary content, this will be a buffer.
   */
  body: string | object | any
  /**
   * The headers of the request.
   */
  headers: { [key: string]: string }
  /**
   * Request HTTP method (GET, POST, ...).
   */
  method: string
  /**
   * Request URL.
   */
  url: string
  /**
   * The HTTP version used in the request. Read only.
   */
  httpVersion: string
}
```

`req` also has some optional properties which can be set to control Cypress-specific behavior:

```ts
{
  /**
   * If provided, the number of milliseconds before an upstream response to this request
   * will time out and cause an error. By default, `responseTimeout` from config is used.
   */
  responseTimeout?: number
  /**
   * Set if redirects should be followed when this request is made. By default, requests will
   * not follow redirects before yielding the response (the 3xx redirect is yielded)
   */
  followRedirect?: boolean
  /**
   * If set, `cy.wait` can be used to await the request/response cycle to complete for this
   * request via `cy.wait('@alias')`.
   */
  alias?: string
}
```

Any modifications to the properties of `req` will be persisted to other request handlers, and finally merged into the actual outbound HTTP request.

### Controlling the outbound request with `req.continue()`

Calling `req.continue()` without any argument will cause the request to be sent outgoing, and the response will be returned to the browser after any other listeners have been called. For example, the following code modifies a `POST` request and then sends it to the upstream server:

```js
cy.intercept('POST', '/submitStory', (req) => {
  req.body.storyName = 'some name'
  // send the modified request and skip any other matching request handlers
  req.continue()
})
```

If a function is passed to `req.continue()`, the request will be sent to the real upstream server, and the callback will be called with the response once the response is fully received from the server. See ["Intercepted responses"][res]

Note: calling `req.continue()` will stop the request from propagating to the next matching request handler in line. See ["Interception lifecycle"][lifecycle] for more information.

### Providing a stub response with `req.reply()`

The `req.reply()` function can be used to send a stub response for an intercepted request. By passing a string, object, or [`StaticResponse`][staticresponse] to `req.reply()`, the request can be preventing from reaching the destination server.

For example, the following code stubs out a JSON response from a request interceptor:

```js
cy.intercept('/billing', (req) => {
  // dynamically get billing plan name at request-time
  const planName = getPlanName()
  // this object will automatically be JSON.stringified and sent as the response
  req.reply({ plan: planName })
})
```

Instead of passing a plain object or string to `req.reply()`, you can also pass a [`StaticResponse`][staticresponse] object. With a [`StaticResponse`][staticresponse], you can force a network error, delay/throttle the response, send a fixture, and more.

For example, the following code serves a dynamically chosen fixture with a delay of 500ms:

```js
cy.intercept('/api/users/*', async (req) => {
  // asynchronously retrieve fixture filename at request-time
  const fixtureFilename = await getFixtureFilenameForUrl(req.url)
  req.reply({
    fixture: fixtureFilename,
    delay: 500,
  })
})
```

See the [`StaticResponse` documentation][staticresponse] for more information on stubbing responses in this manner.

`req.reply()` also supports shorthand, similar to [`res.send()`][res-send], to avoid having to specify a `StaticResponse` object:

```js
req.reply(body) // equivalent to `req.reply({ body })`
req.reply(body, headers) // equivalent to `req.reply({ body, headers })`
req.reply(statusCode, body, headers) // equivalent to `req.reply({ statusCode, body, headers})`
```

There are also two convenience functions available on `req`:

```ts
{
  /**
   * Destroy the request and respond with a network error.
   */
  destroy(): void
  /**
   * Respond to this request with a redirect to a new 'location'.
   * @param statusCode HTTP status code to redirect with. Default: 302
   */
  redirect(location: string, statusCode?: number): void
}
```

Note: calling `req.reply()` will end the request phase and stop the request from propagating to the next matching request handler in line. See ["Interception lifecycle"][lifecycle] for more information.

### Request events

For advanced use, several events are available on `req`, that represent different stages of the [Interception lifecycle][lifecycle].

By calling `req.on`, you can subscribe to different events:

```js
cy.intercept('/shop', (req) => {
  req.on('before:response', (res) => {
    /**
     * Emitted before `response` and before any `req.continue` handlers.
     * Modifications to `res` will be applied to the incoming response.
     * If a promise is returned, it will be awaited before processing other event handlers.
     */
  })

  req.on('response', (res) => {
    /**
     * Emitted after `before:response` and after any `req.continue` handlers - before the response is sent to the browser.
     * Modifications to `res` will be applied to the incoming response.
     * If a promise is returned, it will be awaited before processing other event handlers.
     */
  })

  req.on('after:response', (res) => {
    /**
     * Emitted once the response to a request has finished sending to the browser.
     * Modifications to `res` have no impact.
     * If a promise is returned, it will be awaited before processing other event handlers.
     */
  })
})
```

See ["Intercepted responses"][res] for more details on the `res` object yielded by `before:response` and `response`. See ["Interception lifecycle"][lifecycle] for more details on request ordering.

## Intercepted responses

The response can be intercepted in two ways:

- by passing a callback to [`req.continue()`](req-continue) within a request handler
- by listening for the `before:response` or `response` request events (see ["Request events"](#Request-events))

The response object, `res`, will be passed as the first argument to the handler function:

```js
cy.intercept('/url', (req) => {
  req.on('before:response', (res) => {
    // this will be called before any `req.continue` or `response` handlers
  })

  req.continue((res) => {
    // this will be called after all `before:response` handlers and before any `response` handlers
    // by calling `req.continue`, we signal that this request handler will be the last one, and that
    // the request should be sent outgoing at this point. for that reason, there can only be one
    // `req.continue` handler per request.
  })

  req.on('response', (res) => {
    // this will be called after all `before:response` handlers and after the `req.continue` handler
    // but before the response is sent to the browser
  })
})
```

### Response object properties

The response object (`res`) yielded to response handlers has several properties from the HTTP response itself. All of the following properties on `res` can be modified:

```ts
{
  /**
   * The body of the response.
   * If a JSON Content-Type was used and the body was valid JSON, this will be an object.
   * If the body was binary content, this will be a buffer.
   */
  body: string | object | any
  /**
   * The headers of the response.
   */
  headers: { [key: string]: string }
  /**
   * The HTTP status code of the response.
   */
  statusCode: number
  /**
   * The HTTP status message.
   */
  statusMessage: string
}
```

`res` also has some optional properties which can be set to control Cypress-specific behavior:

```ts
{
  /**
   * Kilobits per second to send 'body'.
   */
  throttleKbps?: number
  /**
   * Milliseconds to delay before the response is sent.
   */
  delay?: number
}
```

Any modifications to the properties of `res` will be persisted to other response handlers, and finally merged into the actual incoming HTTP response.

### Ending the response with `res.send()`

To end the response phase of the request, call `res.send()`. Optionally, you can pass a [`StaticResponse`][staticresponse] to `res.send()`, to be merged with the actual response.

When `res.send()` is called, the response phase will end immediately and no other response handlers will be called for the current request. Here is an example of how `res.send()` could be used:

```js
cy.intercept('/notification', (req) => {
  req.continue((res) => {
    if (res.body.status === 'failed') {
      // sends a fixture body instead of the existing 'res.body'
      res.send({ fixture: 'success.json' })
    }
  })
})
```

See the [`StaticResponse` documentation][staticresponse] for more information on the format.

`res.send()` also supports shorthand, similar to [`req.reply()`][req-reply], to avoid having to specify a `StaticResponse` object:

```js
res.send(body) // equivalent to `res.send({ body })`
res.send(body, headers) // equivalent to `res.send({ body, headers })`
res.send(statusCode, body, headers) // equivalent to `res.send({ statusCode, body, headers})`
```

There are also two convenience functions available on `res`:

```ts
{
  /**
   * Wait for 'delay' milliseconds before sending the response to the client.
   */
  setDelay: (delay: number) => IncomingHttpResponse
  /**
   * Serve the response at 'throttleKbps' kilobytes per second.
   */
  setThrottle: (throttleKbps: number) => IncomingHttpResponse
}
```

Note: calling `res.send()` will end the response phase and stop the response from propagating to the next matching response handler in line. See ["Interception lifecycle"][lifecycle] for more information.

## `StaticResponse` objects

A `StaticResponse` represents a stubbed response to an HTTP request. You can supply a `StaticResponse` to Cypress in 3 ways:

- Directly to `cy.intercept()`, to stub a response to a route: `cy.intercept('/url', staticResponse)`
- To [`req.reply()`][req-reply], to stub a response from a request handler: `req.reply(staticResponse)`
- To [`res.send()`][res-send], to stub a response from a response handler: `res.send(staticResponse)`

The following properties are available on `StaticResponse`. All properties are optional:

```ts
{
  /**
   * Serve a fixture as the response body.
   */
  fixture?: string
  /**
   * Serve a static string/JSON object as the response body.
   */
  body?: string | object | object[]
  /**
   * HTTP headers to accompany the response.
   * @default {}
   */
  headers?: { [key: string]: string }
  /**
   * The HTTP status code to send.
   * @default 200
   */
  statusCode?: number
  /**
   * If 'forceNetworkError' is truthy, Cypress will destroy the browser connection
   * and send no response. Useful for simulating a server that is not reachable.
   * Must not be set in combination with other options.
   */
  forceNetworkError?: boolean
  /**
   * Milliseconds to delay before the response is sent.
   */
  delay?: number
  /**
   * Kilobits per second to send 'body'.
   */
  throttleKbps?: number
}
```

See ["Stubbing a response with a `StaticResponse` object"](#With-a-StaticResponse-object) for examples of stubbing with `cy.intercept()`.

## Interception lifecycle

The lifecycle of a `cy.intercept()` interception begins when an HTTP request is sent from your app that matches one or more registered `cy.intercept()` routes. From there, each interception has two phases: request and response.

`cy.intercept()` routes are matched in reverse order of definition, except for routes which are defined with `{ middleware: true }`, which always run first. This allows you to override existing `cy.intercept()` declarations by defining an overlapping `cy.intercept()`.

### Request phase

The following steps are used to handle the request phase.

1. Start with the first matching route according to the above algorithm (middleware first, followed by handlers in reverse order).
2. Was a handler (body, [`StaticResponse`][staticresponse], or function) supplied to `cy.intercept()`? If not, continue to step 7.
3. If the handler was a body or [`StaticResponse`][staticresponse], immediately end the request with that response.
4. If the handler was a function, call the function with `req`, the incoming request, as the first argument. See ["Intercepted requests"][req] for more information on the `req` object.
   - If [`req.reply()`][req-reply] is called, immediately end the request phase with the provided response. See ["Providing a stub response with `req.reply()`"](#Providing-a-stub-response-with-req-reply).
   - If [`req.continue()`][req-continue] is called, immediately end the request phase, and send the request to the destination server. If a callback is provided to [`req.continue()`][req-continue], it will be called during the [response phase](#Response-phase)
5. If the handler returned a Promise, wait for the Promise to resolve.
6. Merge any modifications to the request object with the real request.
7. If there is another matching `cy.intercept()`, return to step 2 and continue following steps with that route.
8. Send the request outgoing to the destination server and end the request phase. The [response phase](#Response-phase) will begin once a response is received.

### Response phase

Once the HTTP response is received from the upstream server, the following steps are applied:

1. Get a list of registered `before:response` event listeners.
2. For each `before:response` listener (if any), call it with the [`res`][res] object.
   - If [`res.send()`][res-send] is called, end the response phase and merge any passed arguments with the response.
   - If a Promise is returned, await it. Merge any modified response properties with the real response.
3. If a `req.continue()` with callback is declared for this route, call the callback with the [`res`][res] object.
   - If [`res.send()`][res-send] is called, end the response phase and merge any passed arguments with the response.
   - If a Promise is returned, await it. Merge any modified response properties with the real response.
4. Get a list of registered `response` event listeners.
5. For each `response` listener (if any), call it with the [`res`][res] object.
   - If [`res.send()`][res-send] is called, end the response phase and merge any passed arguments with the response.
   - If a Promise is returned, await it. Merge any modified response properties with the real response.
6. Send the response to the browser.
7. Once the response is complete, get a list of registered `after:response` event listeners.
8. For each `after:response` listener (if any), call it with the [`res`][res] object (minus `res.send`)
   - If a Promise is returned, await it.
9. End the response phase.

## Notes

### `cy.intercept()` cannot be debugged using [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request)

#### `cy.request()` sends requests to actual endpoints, bypassing those defined using `cy.intercept()`

The intention of `cy.request()` is to be used for checking endpoints on an actual, running server without having to start the front end application.
