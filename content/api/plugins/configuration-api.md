title: Configuration API
---

Cypress enables you to dynamically modify configuration values and environment
variables from your Cypress configuration.

## Usage

::include{file=partials/warning-setup-node-events.md}

To modify configuration, you return a config object from `setupNodeEvents`
within this exported function.

:::cypress-plugin-example

```js
console.log(config) // see everything in here!

// modify config values
config.defaultCommandTimeout = 10000
config.baseUrl = 'https://staging.acme.com'

// modify env var value
config.env.ENVIRONMENT = 'staging'

// IMPORTANT return the updated config object
return config
```

:::

Whenever you return an object from your `setupNodeEvents` function, Cypress will
take this and "diff" it against the original configuration and automatically set
the resolved values to point to what you returned.

If you don't return an object, then configuration will not be modified.

<Alert type="warning">

The `config` object also includes the following extra values that are not part
of the standard configuration. **These values are read only and cannot be
modified from the `setupNodeEvents` function in the Cypress configuration.**

- `configFile`: The absolute path to the Cypress configuration file. See the
  [--config-file](guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) and
  [configFile](guides/guides/module-api) docs for more information on this
  value.
- `projectRoot`: The absolute path to the root of the project (e.g.
  `/Users/me/dev/my-project`)

</Alert>

Resolved values will show up in the "Settings" tab of the Cypress App.

### Promises

Additionally, Cypress will respect and await promises you return. This enables
you to perform asynchronous tasks and eventually resolve with the modified
configuration object. See the
[example on switching between multiple configuration files](#Switch-between-multiple-configuration-files)
for a full example.

## Examples

### Customize available browsers

The configuration includes the list of browsers found on your system that are
available to Cypress. You can, for example, change or augment that list for
different testing purposes.

<Alert type="info">

Read our full guide on [Launching Browsers](/guides/guides/launching-browsers)
for more information on how this works.

### Switch between multiple configuration files

::include{file=partials/warning-plugins-file.md}

This means you can do things like store multiple configuration files and switch
between them like:

- `cypress.qa.json`
- `cypress.dev.json`
- `cypress.prod.json`

How you choose to organize your configuration and environment variables is up to
you.

```javascript
// promisified fs module
const fs = require('fs-extra')
const path = require('path')

function getConfigurationByFile(file) {
  const pathToConfigFile = path.resolve('..', 'config', `${file}.json`)

  return fs.readJson(pathToConfigFile)
}

// plugins file
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  // accept a configFile value or use development by default
  const file = config.env.configFile || 'development'

  return getConfigurationByFile(file)
}
```

You could now swap out configuration + environment variables like so:

```shell
cypress run
```

```shell
cypress run --env configFile=qa
```

```shell
cypress run --env configFile=staging
```

```shell
cypress run --env configFile=production
```

Each of these environments would read in the configuration at these files:

```text
cypress/config/development.json
cypress/config/qa.json
cypress/config/staging.json
cypress/config/production.json
```

This would enable you to do things like this:

```json
// cypress/config/development.json

{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:1234",
  "env": {
    "something": "development"
  }
}
```

```json
// cypress/config/qa.json

{
  "baseUrl": "https://qa.acme.com",
  "env": {
    "something": "qa"
  }
}
```

```json
// cypress/config/staging.json

{
  "baseUrl": "https://staging.acme.com",
  "env": {
    "something": "staging"
  }
}
```

```json
// cypress/config/production.json

{
  "baseUrl": "https://production.acme.com",
  "env": {
    "something": "production"
  }
}
```

This is a less complicated example. Remember - you have the full power of Node
at your disposal.

How you choose to edit the configuration is up to you. You don't have to read
off of the file system - you could store them all in memory inside of
[setupNodeEvents](/guides/tooling/plugins-guide#Using-a-plugin) if you wanted.

### Test Type-Specific Plugins

You can access the type of tests running via the `config.testingType` property.
The testing type is either `e2e` or `component` depending on if the
[E2E Testing](/guides/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-E2E-Testing) or
[Component Testing](/guides/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-Component-Testing)
type was selected in the Cypress App. This allows you to configure test
type-specific plugins.
