title: Writing a Plugin
---

The Plugins API allows you to hook into and extend Cypress behavior.

<Alert type="info">

**Note:** This document assumes you have read the [Plugins Guide](/guides/tooling/plugins-guide).

</Alert>

## Plugins API

To get started, open up this file:

```text
cypress/plugins/index.js
```

The plugins file must export a function with the following signature:

```javascript
// cypress/plugins/index.js

// export a function
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  // configure plugins here
}
```

<Alert type="warning">

⚠️ This code is part of the [plugins file](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html#Plugin-files) and thus executes in the Node environment. You cannot call `Cypress` or `cy` commands in this file, but you do have the direct access to the file system and the rest of the operating system.

</Alert>

The exported function is called whenever a project is opened either with [cypress open](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) or [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run).

Your function will receive 2 arguments: `on` and `config`.

You can return a synchronous function, or you can also return a Promise, and it will be awaited until it resolves. This enables you to perform asynchronous actions in your exported function such as reading files in from the filesystem.

If you return or resolve with an object, Cypress will then merge this object into the `config` which enables you to overwrite configuration or environment variables.

### on

`on` is a function that you will use to register listeners on various **events** that Cypress exposes.

Registering to listen on an event looks like this:

```javascript
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('<event>', (arg1, arg2) => {
    // plugin stuff here
  })
}
```

Each event documents its own argument signature. To understand how to use them, please [refer to the docs for each one](#List-of-events).

### config

`config` is the resolved [Cypress configuration](/guides/references/configuration) of the opened project.

This configuration contains all of the values that get passed into the browser for your project.

[For a comprehensive list of all configuration values look here.](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/master/packages/server/lib/config.js)

Some plugins may utilize or require these values, so they can take certain actions based on the configuration.

You can programmatically modify these values and Cypress will then respect these changes. This enables you to swap out configuration based on things like the environment you're running in.

<Alert type="warning">

The `config` object also includes the following extra values that are not part of the standard configuration. **These values are read only and cannot be modified from the plugins file.**

- `configFile`: The absolute path to the config file. By default, this is `<projectRoot>/cypress.json`, but may be a custom path or `false` if using the [`--config-file` flag](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open-config-file-lt-config-file-gt).
- `projectRoot`: The absolute path to the root of the project (e.g. `/Users/me/dev/my-project`)
- `version`: The version number of Cypress. This can be used to handle breaking changes.

</Alert>

### List of events

#### The following events are available:

| Event                                                      | Description                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`after:run`](/api/plugins/after-run-api)                  | Occurs after the run is finished.                                               |
| [`after:screenshot`](/api/plugins/after-screenshot-api)    | Occurs after a screenshot is taken.                                             |
| [`after:spec`](/api/plugins/after-spec-api)                | Occurs after a spec is finished running.                                        |
| [`before:browser:launch`](/api/plugins/browser-launch-api) | Occurs immediately before launching a browser.                                  |
| [`before:run`](/api/plugins/before-run-api)                | Occurs before the run starts.                                                   |
| [`before:spec`](/api/plugins/before-spec-api)              | Occurs when a spec is about to be run.                                          |
| [`file:preprocessor`](/api/plugins/preprocessors-api)      | Occurs when a spec or spec-related file needs to be transpiled for the browser. |
| [`task`](/api/commands/task)                               | Occurs in conjunction with the `cy.task` command.                               |

## Execution context

Your `pluginsFile` is invoked when Cypress opens a project.

Cypress does this by spawning an independent `child_process` which then `requires` in your `pluginsFile`. This is similar to the way Visual Studio Code or Atom works.

You will need to keep in mind it is **Cypress who is requiring your file** - not your local project, not your local Node version, and not anything else under your control.

Because of this, this global context and the version of Node is controlled under Cypress.

<Alert type="warning">

<strong class="alert-header">Node version</strong>

Keep in mind - code executed in plugins **may** be executed by the Node version that comes bundled in Cypress itself.

This version of Node has **nothing to do** with your locally installed versions. Therefore you may want to write Node code which is compatible with this version or document that the user of your plugin will need to set a specific [nodeVersion](/guides/references/configuration#Node-version) in their configuration.

You can find the current Node version we use when the `nodeVersion` is set to the default `bundled` [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/master/.node-version).

</Alert>

### npm modules

When Cypress executes your `pluginsFile` it will execute with `process.cwd()` set to your project's path. Additionally - you will be able to `require` **any node module** you have installed.

You can also `require` local files relative to your project.

**For example, if your `package.json` looked like this:**

```json
{
  "name": "My Project",
  "dependencies": {
    "debug": "x.x.x"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "lodash": "x.x.x"
  }
}
```

**Then you could do any of the following in your `pluginsFile`:**

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js

const _ = require('lodash') // yup, dev dependencies
const path = require('path') // yup, built in node modules
const debug = require('debug') // yup, dependencies
const User = require('../../lib/models/user') // yup, relative local modules

console.log(__dirname) // /Users/janelane/Dev/my-project/cypress/plugins/index.js

console.log(process.cwd()) // /Users/janelane/Dev/my-project
```

## Error handling

Cypress spawns your `pluginsFile` in its own child process so it is isolated away from the context that Cypress itself runs in. That means you cannot accidentally modify or change Cypress's own execution in any way.

If your `pluginsFile` has an uncaught exception, an unhandled rejection from a promise, or a syntax error - we will automatically catch those and display them to you inside of the console and even in the Test Runner itself.

Errors from your plugins _will not crash_ Cypress.

## File changes

Normally when writing code in Node, you typically have to restart the process after changing any files.

With Cypress, we automatically watch your `pluginsFile` and any changes made will take effect immediately. We will read the file in and execute the exported function again.

This enables you to iterate on plugin code even with Cypress already running.
