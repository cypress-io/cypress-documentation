title: Cypress.session

`Cypress.session` is a collection of session-related helper methods intended to
be used alongside the [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) command.

<Alert type="warning">

<strong class="alert-header"><Icon name="exclamation-triangle"></Icon>
Experimental</strong>

The `session` API is currently experimental, and can be enabled by setting the
[`experimentalSessionSupport`](/guides/references/experiments) flag to `true` in
the Cypress config or by using [`Cypress.config()`](/api/cypress-api/config) at
the top of a spec file.

Enabling this flag does the following:

- It adds the [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) command for use in tests.
- It adds the [`Cypress.session`](/api/cypress-api/session) API.
- It adds the following new behaviors (that will be the default in a future
  major update of Cypress) at the beginning of each test:
  - The page is cleared (by setting it to `about:blank`).
  - All active session data (cookies, `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`)
    across all domains are cleared.
- It overrides the
  [`Cypress.Cookies.preserveOnce()`](/api/cypress-api/cookies#Preserve-Once) and
  [`Cypress.Cookies.defaults()`](/api/cypress-api/cookies#Defaults) methods.

Because the page is cleared before each test,
[`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) must be explicitly called in each test to
visit a page in your application.

## Syntax

Clear all saved sessions and re-run the current spec file.

```javascript
Cypress.session.clearAllSavedSessions()
```

This can also be done by clicking the "Clear All Sessions" button in the
[Sessions Instrument Panel](/api/commands/session#The-Instrument-Panel).
