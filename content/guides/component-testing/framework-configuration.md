title: Framework Configuration
containerClass: component-testing
---

Recent years have seen an explosion in component based libraries (Vue, React)
and frameworks built on top of them (Nuxt, Next). Cypress tests are written and
behave the same regardless. Some frameworks require some additional
configuration to work correctly with Cypress component testing.

All the example projects described in this page can be found
[here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-examples).

## React (Create React App)

This guide assumes you've created your app using
[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/documentation-intro). You
can find an example project
[here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-examples/tree/main/create-react-app).

Once you have a React project, you'll also need to install the Cypress Webpack
Dev Server and React adapter, as well as some devDependencies:

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress @cypress/react @cypress/webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin@4
```

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">Note</strong>

`html-webpack-plugin@4` is required because the projects created with Create
React App use Webpack v4.

</Alert>

Next configure the dev-server to use the same Webpack configuration used by
Create React App. We can do this easily using the `react-scripts` plugin
provided by Cypress. Place the following in `cypress/plugins/index.js`, creating
the relevant directories.

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js

const injectDevServer = require('@cypress/react/plugins/react-scripts')

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  injectDevServer(on, config)

  return config
}
```

Lastly, tell Cypress where you find your test in `cypress.json`. In this example
all the tests are in `src` and named `test.js`:

```json
{
  "testFiles": "**/*.test.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  "componentFolder": "src"
}
```

Finally, add a test. We will replace the default test (using Testing Library)
with one using Cypress:

```jsx
// src/App.test.js

import React from 'react'
import { mount } from '@cypress/react'
import App from './App'

it('renders learn react link', () => {
  mount(<App />)
  cy.get('a').contains('Learn React')
})
```

Start Cypress with `npx cypress open-ct` - the test runner will open. Select
your test to execute it and see the rendered output. You can also run the tests
without opening a browser with `npx cypress run-ct`.

## Vue (Vue CLI)

Cypress works with both Vue 2 and Vue 3. The configuration is almost identical.

### Vue 2 (Vue CLI)

This guide assumes you've created your app using the
[Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/). This documentation was written using Vue CLI
v4.5.12. You can find an example project
[here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-examples/tree/main/vue-cli-vue-2-cypress).

You'll also need to install the Cypress Webpack Dev Server and Vue 2 adapter, as
well as some devDependencies:

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress @cypress/vue @cypress/webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin@4
```

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">Note</strong>

`html-webpack-plugin@4` is required because the projects created with the Vue
CLI v4 use Webpack v4. If you are using Vue CLI v5 (currently in alpha) you will
need `html-webpack-plugin@5` instead.

</Alert>

Next configure the dev-server to use the same Webpack configuration used by Vue
CLI. Place the following in `cypress/plugins/index.js`, creating the relevant
directories.

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js

const { startDevServer } = require('@cypress/webpack-dev-server')
const webpackConfig = require('@vue/cli-service/webpack.config')

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('dev-server:start', (options) => {
    return startDevServer({
      options,
      webpackConfig,
    })
  })
}
```

<Alert type="warning">

<strong class="alert-header">PWA Caveat</strong>

If you are using the Vue CLI's PWA feature, there is a known caveat regarding
configuration. See
[here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15968#issuecomment-819170918)
for more information.

</Alert>

Lastly, tell Cypress where you find your test in `cypress.json`. In this example
all the tests are in `src` and named `spec.js`:

```json
{
  "testFiles": "**/*.spec.js",
  "componentFolder": "src"
}
```

Finally, add a test:

```jsx
// src/components/HelloWorld.spec.js

import { mount } from '@cypress/vue'
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld.vue'

it('renders a message', () => {
  mount(HelloWorld, {
    propsData: {
      msg: 'Hello Cypress!',
    },
  })

  cy.get('h1').contains('Hello Cypress!')
})
```

Start Cypress with `npx cypress open-ct` - the test runner will open. Select
your test to execute it and see the rendered output. You can also run the tests
without opening a browser with `npx cypress run-ct`.

### Vue 3 (Vue CLI)

The installation and configuration is the same as Vue 2 with the Vue CLI as
described above. The only difference is the Vue adapter should be installed
using `npm install @cypress/vue@next` - `@cypress/vue` targets Vue 2, and the
`next` branch targets Vue 3.

You can find an example project
[here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-examples/tree/main/vue-cli-vue-3-cypress).

## Next.js

It's possible to use Cypress with the latest version of Next.js, which uses
Webpack 4, as well as with Webpack 5 via `next.config.js` with `webpack5: true`.
You can find an example project
[here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-examples/tree/main/nextjs-webpack-4).

### Next.js (Webpack 4)

This guide assumes you've created your app using the
[`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) tool.
Although Next.js is webpack based, it doesn't have it as a direct dependency, so
you'll need to install it. You'll also need to install the cypress webpack dev
server and react adapter:

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress @cypress/webpack-dev-server @cypress/react html-webpack-plugin@4 webpack@4 webpack-dev-server@3
```

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">Note</strong>

Note we are installing `html-webpack-plugin@4` and `webpack@4`. Those are the
versions that correspond to the current version of Next.js.

</Alert>

Next configure the dev-server using the Next.js adapter shipped with
`@cypress/react` by adding the following code to `cypress/plugins/index.js`,
creating the relevant directories:

```js
const injectDevServer = require('@cypress/react/plugins/next')

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  injectDevServer(on, config)

  return config
}
```

Lastly, tell Cypress where you find your test in `cypress.json`. In this example
all the tests are in `cypress/pages`:

```json
{
  "testFiles": "*_/_.spec.{js,jsx}",
  "componentFolder": "cypress/pages"
}
```

Finally, add a test in `cypress/pages`:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { mount } from '@cypress/react'
import IndexPage from '../../pages/index'

it('Renders page component', () => {
  mount(<IndexPage />)
  cy.contains('Welcome to Next.js')
})
```

Start Cypress with `npx cypress open-ct` - the test runner will open. Select
your test to execute it and see the rendered output. You can also run the tests
without opening a browser with `npx cypress run-ct`.

<Alert type="warning">

<strong class="alert-header">Caveats</strong>

There are some Next.js specific caveats due to its server side architecture
relating to `getInitialProps` and `getStaticProps`.
[Learn more here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/react/examples/nextjs#server-side-props).

</Alert>

### Next.js (Webpack 5)

You can also use Cypress component testing with Next.js and Webpack 5. The
process is the same as with Webpack 4, described above, with a few key
differences.

In your `next.config.js`, tell Next.js to use webpack 5:

```js
module.exports = {
  future: {
    webpack5: true,
  },
}
```

Finally, ensure you install Webpack 5 and the corresponding HTMLWebpackPlugin
version:

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress @cypress/webpack-dev-server @cypress/react html-webpack-plugin@5 webpack@5 webpack-dev-server@3
```

Everything else is the same as configuring Cypress with Next.js and Webpack 4.

## Nuxt

This guide assumes you've created your app using the [`create-nuxt-app`]. You
can find the completed example project
[here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-examples/tree/main/nuxt-vue-2-cypress).

Nuxt uses Vue 2 and Webpack under the hood, so you also need to install the
Cypress Webpack Dev Server and Vue 2 adapter, as well as some devDependencies:

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress @cypress/vue @cypress/webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin@4
```

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">Note</strong>

`html-webpack-plugin@4` is required because the projects created with the Vue
CLI v4 use Webpack v4.

</Alert>

Next configure the dev-server to use the same Webpack configuration used by
Nuxt. Place the following in `cypress/plugins/index.js`, creating the relevant
directories.

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js

const { startDevServer } = require('@cypress/webpack-dev-server')
const { getWebpackConfig } = require('nuxt')

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('dev-server:start', async (options) => {
    const webpackConfig = await getWebpackConfig()
    return startDevServer({
      options,
      webpackConfig,
    })
  })
}
```

Lastly, tell Cypress where you find your tests in `cypress.json`. While it's
possible to mount components in the `pages` directory, generally you will want
to be more granular with your component tests - full page tests are best
implemented with Cypress e2e runner.

In this example we specify the `componentFolder` as `components`, the default
for Nuxt.

```json
{
  "testFiles": "**/*.spec.js",
  "componentFolder": "components"
}
```

Finally, add a component and test:

```html
<!-- components/mountains.vue -->

<template>
  <p v-if="$fetchState.pending">Fetching mountains...</p>
  <p v-else-if="$fetchState.error">An error occurred :(</p>
  <div v-else>
    <h1>Nuxt Mountains</h1>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="mountain of mountains">{{ mountain.title }}</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        mountains: [],
      }
    },
    async fetch() {
      this.mountains = await fetch(
        'https://api.nuxtjs.dev/mountains'
      ).then((res) => res.json())
    },
  }
</script>
```

```js
// components/mountains.spec.js
import { mount } from '@cypress/vue'
import Mountains from './mountains.vue'

describe('Mountains', () => {
  it('shows a load state', () => {
    mount(Mountains, {
      mocks: {
        $fetchState: {
          pending: true,
        },
      },
    })

    cy.get('p').contains('Fetching mountains...')
  })

  it('shows a failed state', () => {
    mount(Mountains, {
      mocks: {
        $fetchState: {
          error: true,
        },
      },
    })

    cy.get('p').contains('An error occurred :(')
  })

  it('shows a failed state', () => {
    mount(Mountains, {
      data() {
        return {
          mountains: [{ title: 'Mt Everest' }],
        }
      },
      mocks: {
        $fetchState: {},
      },
    })

    cy.get('li').contains('Mt Everest')
  })
})
```

Because Cypress mounts components in isolation, Nuxt specific APIs are generally
_not_ applied. In this example, the `fetch` hook is not automatically applied,
so we used the `mocks` mounting option to specify the three component states
(loading, error and success) and test each one in isolation.

Start Cypress with `npx cypress open-ct` - the test runner will open. Select
your test to execute it and see the rendered output. You can also run the tests
without opening a browser with `npx cypress run-ct`.

## Vite Based Projects (Vue, React)

Cypress also ships a Vite based dev server, as opposed to a Webpack based on
like the other examples on this page. This example uses a Vite project with
React, created via `npm init @vitejs/app my-react-app -- --template react`. The
configuration instructions are the same for Vue. There is an example React
project
[here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-examples/tree/main/vite-react)
and a Vue project
[here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-component-examples/tree/main/vite-vue).

Inside of `cypress/plugins/index.js`, configure Cypress to use the Vite dev
server:

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js

const path = require('path')
const { startDevServer } = require('@cypress/vite-dev-server')

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('dev-server:start', (options) => {
    return startDevServer({
      options,
      viteConfig: {
        configFile: path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..', 'vite.config.js'),
      },
    })
  })
}
```

Lastly, tell Cypress where you find your test in `cypress.json`. In this example
all the tests are in `src` and named `spec.jsx`:

```json
{
  "testFiles": "**/*.spec.jsx",
  "componentFolder": "src"
}
```

Finally, add a test in `src/App.spec.jsx`:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { mount } from '@cypress/react'
import App from './App'

it('renders learn react link', () => {
  mount(<App />)
  cy.get('a').contains('Learn React')
})
```

Start Cypress with `npx cypress open-ct` - the test runner will open. Select
your test to execute it and see the rendered output. You can also run the tests
without opening a browser with `npx cypress run-ct`.
