## <Icon name="graduation-cap"></Icon> What you'll learn

- How Cypress runs in the same event loop with your code, keeping debugging less
  demanding and more understandable
- How Cypress embraces the standard Developer Tools
- How and when to use `debugger` and the shorthand
  [`.debug()`](/api/commands/debug) command

</Alert>

## Using `debugger`

Your Cypress test code runs in the same run loop as your application. This means
you have access to the code running on the page, as well as the things the
browser makes available to you, like `document`, `window`, and `debugger`.

### Debug just like you always do

Based on those statements, you might be tempted to throw a `debugger` into your
test, like so:

:::visit-mount-test-example

```js
cy.visit('/my/page/path')
```

```js
cy.mount(<MyComponent />)
```

```js
it('let me debug like a fiend', () => {
  __VISIT_MOUNT_PLACEHOLDER__

  cy.get('[data-testid="selector-in-question"]')

  debugger // Doesn't work
})
```

:::

This may not work exactly as you are expecting. As you may remember from the
[Introduction to Cypress](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress), `cy`
commands enqueue an action to be taken later. Can you see what the test above
will do given that perspective?

Both [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) and [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get)
will return immediately, having enqueued their work to be done later, and
`debugger` will be executed before any of the commands have actually run. The
same behavior is expected in Component Tests when using
[`cy.mount()`](/api/commands/mount).

Let's use [`.then()`](/api/commands/then) to tap into the Cypress command during
execution and add a `debugger` at the appropriate time:

:::visit-mount-test-example

```js
cy.visit('/my/page/path')

cy.get('[data-testid="selector-in-question"]').then(($selectedElement) => {
  // Debugger is hit after the cy.visit
  // and cy.get commands have completed
  debugger
})
```

```js
cy.mount(<MyComponent />)

cy.get('[data-testid="selector-in-question"]').then(($selectedElement) => {
  // Debugger is hit after the cy.mount
  // and cy.get commands have completed
  debugger
})
```

```js
it('let me debug when the after the command executes', () => {
  __VISIT_MOUNT_PLACEHOLDER__
})
```

:::

Now we're in business! When you're visiting a page or mounting a component for
the first time, (shown above with the [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get)chain and
its [`.then()`](/api/commands/then) attached) the commands are enqueued for
Cypress to execute. The `it` block exits, and Cypress starts its work:

1. In an end-to-end test, the page is visited and Cypress waits for it to load.
   Alternatively, the component is mounted and rendered in a Component Test.
2. The element is queried, and Cypress automatically waits and retries for a few
   moments if it isn't found immediately.
3. The function passed to [`.then()`](/api/commands/then) is executed, with the
   found element yielded to it.
4. Within the context of the [`.then()`](/api/commands/then) function, the
   `debugger` is called, halting the browser and calling focus to the Developer
   Tools.
5. You're in! Inspect the state of your application like you normally would if
   you'd dropped the `debugger` into your application code.

### Using [`.debug()`](/api/commands/debug)

Cypress also exposes a shortcut for debugging commands,
[`.debug()`](/api/commands/debug). Let's rewrite the test above using this
helper method:

:::visit-mount-test-example

```js
cy.visit('/my/page/path')
```

```js
cy.mount(<MyComponent />)
```

```js
it('let me debug like a fiend', () => {
  __VISIT_MOUNT_PLACEHOLDER__

  cy.get('[data-testid="selector-in-question"]').debug()
})
```

:::

The current subject that is yielded by the [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get) is
exposed as the variable `subject` within your Developer Tools so that you can
interact with it in the console.

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/debugging/debugging-subject.png" alt="Debugging Subject"></DocsImage>

Use [`.debug()`](/api/commands/debug) to quickly inspect any (or many!) part(s)
of your application during the test. You can attach it to any Cypress chain of
commands to have a look at the system's state at that moment.

## Step through test commands

You can run the test command by command using the
[`.pause()`](/api/commands/pause) command.

```javascript
it('adds items', () => {
  cy.pause()
  cy.get('[data-testid="new-todo"]')
  // more commands
})
```

This allows you to inspect the web application, the DOM, the network, and any
storage after each command to make sure everything happens as expected.

## Using the Developer Tools

Though Cypress has built out
[an excellent application](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app) to help you
understand what is happening in your application and your tests, there's no
replacing all the amazing work browser teams have done on their built-in
development tools. Once again, we see that Cypress goes _with_ the flow of the
modern ecosystem, opting to leverage these tools wherever possible.

### Get console logs for commands

All of Cypress's commands, when clicked on within the
[Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log), print extra
information about the command, its subject, and its yielded result. Try clicking
around the Command Log with your Developer Tools open! You may find some useful
information here.

#### When clicking on `.type()` command, the Developer Tools console outputs the following:

## Errors

Sometimes tests fail. Sometimes we want them to fail, just so we know they're
testing the right thing when they pass. But other times, tests fail
unintentionally and we need to figure out why. Cypress provides some tools to
help make that process as easy as possible.

### Anatomy of an error

Let's take a look at the anatomy of an error and how it is displayed in Cypress,
by way of a failing test.

```js
it('reroutes on users page', () => {
  cy.contains('Users').click()
  cy.url().should('include', 'users')
})
```

The center of the `<li>Users</li>` element is hidden from view in our
application under test, so the test above will fail.

::include{file=partials/anatomy-of-an-error.md}

### Source maps

Cypress utilizes source maps to enhance the error experience. Stack traces are
translated so that your source files are shown instead of the generated file
that is loaded by the browser. This also enables displaying code frames. Without
inline source maps, you will not see code frames.

By default, Cypress will include an inline source map in your spec file, so you
will get the most out of the error experience. If you
[modify the preprocessor](/api/plugins/preprocessors-api), ensure that inline
source maps are enabled to get the same experience. With webpack and the
[webpack preprocessor](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/master/npm/webpack-preprocessor),
for example, set
[the `devtool` option](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/) to
`inline-source-map`.

## Debugging flake

While Cypress is
[flake-resistant](/guides/overview/key-differences#Flake-resistant), some users
do experience flake, particularly when running in CI versus locally. Most often
in cases of flaky tests, we see that there are not enough assertions surrounding
test actions or network requests before moving on to the next assertion.

If there is any variation in the speed of the network requests or responses when
run locally versus in CI, then there can be failures in one over the other.

Because of this, we recommend asserting on as many required steps as possible
before moving forward with the test. This also helps later to isolate where the
exact failure is when debugging.

Flake can also occur when there are differences between your local and CI
environments. You can use the following methods troubleshoot tests that pass
locally but fail in CI.

- Review your CI build process to ensure nothing is changing with your
  application that would result in failing tests.
- Remove time-sensitive variability in your tests. For example, ensure a network
  request has finished before looking for the DOM element that relies on the
  data from that network request. You can leverage
  [aliasing](/guides/core-concepts/variables-and-aliases#Aliases) for this.

The Cypress Dashboard also offers [Analytics](/guides/dashboard/analytics) that
illustrate trends in your tests and can help identify the tests that fail most
often. This could help narrow down what is causing the flake -- for example,
seeing increased failures after a change to the test environment could indicate
issues with the new environment.

For more advice on dealing with flake read a
[series of our blog posts](https://cypress.io/blog/tag/flake/) and
[Identifying Code Smells in Cypress](https://codingitwrong.com/2020/10/09/identifying-code-smells-in-cypress.html)
by [Cypress Ambassador](https://www.cypress.io/ambassadors/) Josh Justice.

## Log Cypress events

Cypress emits multiple events you can listen to as shown below.
[Read more about logging events in the browser here](/api/events/catalog-of-events#Logging-All-Events).

<DocsImage src="/img/api/catalog-of-events/console-log-events-debug.png" alt="console log events for debugging" ></DocsImage>

## Run Cypress command outside the test

If you need to run a Cypress command straight from the Developer Tools console,
you can use the internal command `cy.now('command name', ...arguments)`. For
example, to run the equivalent of `cy.task('database', 123)` outside the normal
execution command chain:

```javascript
cy.now('task', 123).then(console.log)
// runs cy.task(123) and prints the resolved value
```

<Alert type="warning">

The `cy.now()` command is an internal command and may change in the future.

## Cypress fiddle

While learning Cypress it may be a good idea to try small tests against some
HTML. We have written a
[@cypress/fiddle](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-fiddle) plugin for this.
It can quickly mount any given HTML and run some Cypress test commands against
it.

## Troubleshooting Cypress

There are times when you will encounter errors or unexpected behavior with
Cypress itself. In this situation, we recommend checking out our
[Troubleshooting Guide](/guides/references/troubleshooting).

Often debugging a failing Cypress test means understanding better how your own
application works, and how the application might race against the test commands.
