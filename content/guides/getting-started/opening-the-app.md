## `cypress open`

Now you can open Cypress from your **project root** one of the following ways:

**Using `npx`**

**Note**: [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) is included with `npm > v5.2`
or can be installed separately.

```shell
npx cypress open
```

**Or by using `yarn`**

```shell
yarn run cypress open
```

**The long way with the full path**

```shell
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```

**Or with the shortcut using `npm bin`**

```shell
$(npm bin)/cypress open
```

After a moment, the Cypress App will launch.

### Adding npm Scripts

While there's nothing wrong with writing out the full path to the Cypress
executable each time, it's much easier and clearer to add Cypress commands to
the `scripts` field in your `package.json` file.

```javascript
{
  "scripts": {
    "cypress:open": "cypress open"
  }
}
```

Now you can invoke the command from your project root like so:

```shell
npm run cypress:open
```

...and Cypress will open right up for you.

### CLI tools

By installing Cypress through `npm` you also get access to many other CLI
commands. On top of that, Cypress is also a fully baked JavaScript library you
can import into your Node scripts.

You can [read more about the CLI here](/guides/guides/command-line).

## The Launchpad

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app/launchpad.png" alt="The Launchpad window"></DocsImage>

On opening Cypress, your testing journey begins with the Launchpad. Its job is
to guide you through the decisions and configuration tasks you need to complete
before you start writing your first test.

If this is your first time using Cypress it will take you through the following
steps in order.

### Choosing a Testing Type

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app/choose-testing-type.png" alt="The Launchpad test type selector"></DocsImage>

The Launchpad presents you with your biggest decision first: What type of
testing shall I do?
[E2E Testing](/guides/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-E2E-Testing), where I
run my whole application and visit pages to test them? Or
[Component Testing](/guides/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-Component-Testing),
where I mount individual components of my app and test them in isolation?

For more background on this critical decision, read
[Testing Types](/guides/core-concepts/testing-types). Alternatively, if you're
not sure which type you want and just want to get on with your testing journey,
just choose **E2E** for now - you can always change this later!

### Quick Configuration

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app/scaffolded-files.png" alt="The Launchpad scaffolded files list"></DocsImage>

On the next step, the Launchpad will scaffold out a set of configuration files
appropriate to your chosen testing type, and the changes will be listed for you
to review. For more information about the generated config check out the
[Cypress configuration reference](/guides/references/configuration), or you can
just scroll down and hit "Continue".

### Launching a Browser

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app/select-browser.png" alt="The Launchpad browser selector"></DocsImage>

Lastly, you're presented with the list of compatible browsers Cypress found on
your system. To understand more about your options here, see
[our guide on launching browsers](/guides/guides/launching-browsers). Again,
don't sweat it, you can switch browsers whenever you want. Now <strong>MASH THAT
START BUTTON!</strong>

## Next Steps

Time to get testing! If you chose
[to start with E2E Testing, go here](/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test).
Alternatively, if you decided
[to try Component Testing, go here](/guides/component-testing/writing-your-first-component-test).
