## System requirements

#### Operating System

Cypress is a desktop application that is installed on your computer. The desktop
application supports these operating systems:

- **macOS** 10.9 and above _(64-bit only)_
- **Linux** Ubuntu 12.04 and above, Fedora 21 and Debian 8 _(64-bit only)_
- **Windows** 7 and above _(64-bit only)_

#### Node.js

If you're using `npm` to install Cypress, we support:

- **Node.js** 12 or 14 and above

#### Linux

If you're using Linux, you'll want to have the required dependencies installed
on your system.

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```shell
apt-get install libgtk2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm-dev libnotify-dev libgconf-2-4 libnss3 libxss1 libasound2 libxtst6 xauth xvfb
```

#### CentOS

```shell
yum install -y xorg-x11-server-Xvfb gtk2-devel gtk3-devel libnotify-devel GConf2 nss libXScrnSaver alsa-lib
```

#### Docker

Docker images with all of the required dependencies installed are available
under [cypress/base](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images)

If you're running your projects in containers, then you'll want Cypress in the
container with the Node.js process.

```
  ui:
    image: cypress/base:latest
    # if targeting a specific node version, use e.g.
    # image: cypress/base:14
```

`cypress/base` is a drop-in replacement for
[base docker node images](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/).

## Installing

### <Icon name="terminal"></Icon> `npm install`

Install Cypress via `npm`:

```shell
cd /your/project/path
```

```shell
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

This will install Cypress locally as a dev dependency for your project.

<Alert type="info">

Make sure that you have already run
[`npm init`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or have a `node_modules` folder or
`package.json` file in the root of your project to ensure cypress is installed
in the correct directory.

</Alert>

<DocsVideo src="/img/snippets/installing-cli.mp4"></DocsVideo>

<Alert type="info">

Notice that the Cypress `npm` package is a wrapper around the Cypress binary.
The version of the `npm` package determines the version of the binary
downloaded. As of version `3.0`, the binary is downloaded to a global cache
directory to be used across projects.

System proxy properties `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` are respected
for the download of the Cypress binary. You can also use the npm properties
`npm_config_proxy` and `npm_config_https_proxy`. Those have lower priority, so
they will only be used if the system properties are being resolved to not use a
proxy.

</Alert>

<Alert type="success">

<strong class="alert-header">Best Practice</strong>

The recommended approach is to install Cypress with `npm` because :

- Cypress is versioned like any other dependency.
- It simplifies running Cypress in
  [Continuous Integration](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction).

</Alert>

### <Icon name="terminal"></Icon> `yarn add`

Installing Cypress via [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com):

```shell
cd /your/project/path
```

```shell
yarn add cypress --dev
```

System proxy properties `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` are respected
for the download of the Cypress binary.

### <Icon name="download"></Icon> Direct download

If you're not using Node or `npm` in your project or you want to try Cypress out
quickly, you can always
[download Cypress directly from our CDN](https://download.cypress.io/desktop).

<Alert type="warning">

Recording runs to the Dashboard is not possible from the direct download. This
download is only intended as a quick way to try out Cypress. To record tests to
the Dashboard, you'll need to install Cypress as an `npm` dependency.

</Alert>

The direct download will always grab the latest available version. Your platform
will be detected automatically.

Then you can manually unzip and double click. Cypress will run without needing
to install any dependencies.

<DocsVideo src="/img/snippets/installing-global.mp4"></DocsVideo>

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">Direct downloading for old versions</strong>

It is possible to download an old version from our CDN by suffixing the URL with
the desired version (ex.
[https://download.cypress.io/desktop/6.8.0](https://download.cypress.io/desktop/6.8.0)).

</Alert>

### <Icon name="sync-alt"></Icon> Continuous integration

Please read our
[Continuous Integration](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction) docs for
help installing Cypress in CI. When running in linux you'll need to install some
[system dependencies](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Dependencies)
or you can use our [Docker images](/examples/examples/docker) which have
everything you need prebuilt.

## Opening Cypress

If you used `npm` to install, Cypress has now been installed to your
`./node_modules` directory, with its binary executable accessible from
`./node_modules/.bin`.

Now you can open Cypress from your **project root** one of the following ways:

**The long way with the full path**

```shell
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```

**Or with the shortcut using `npm bin`**

```shell
$(npm bin)/cypress open
```

**Or by using `npx`**

**note**: [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) is included with `npm > v5.2`
or can be installed separately.

```shell
npx cypress open
```

**Or by using `yarn`**

```shell
yarn run cypress open
```

After a moment, the Cypress Test Runner will launch.

### Switching browsers

The Cypress Test Runner attempts to find all compatible browsers on the user's
machine. The drop down to select a different browser is in the top right corner
of the Test Runner.

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/browser-list-dropdown.png" alt="Select a different browser" ></DocsImage>

Read [Launching Browsers](/guides/guides/launching-browsers) for more
information on how Cypress controls a real browser during end-to-end tests.

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">Cross Browser Support</strong>

Cypress currently supports Firefox and Chrome-family browsers (including Edge
and Electron). To run tests optimally across these browsers in CI, check out the
strategies demonstrated in the
[cross browser Testing](/guides/guides/cross-browser-testing) guide.

</Alert>

### Adding npm scripts

While there's nothing wrong with writing out the full path to the Cypress
executable each time, it's much easier and clearer to add Cypress commands to
the `scripts` field in your `package.json` file.

```javascript
{
  "scripts": {
    "cypress:open": "cypress open"
  }
}
```

Now you can invoke the command from your project root like so:

```shell
npm run cypress:open
```

...and Cypress will open right up for you.

## CLI tools

By installing Cypress through `npm` you also get access to many other CLI
commands.

As of version `0.20.0` Cypress is also a fully baked `node_module` you can
require in your Node scripts.

You can [read more about the CLI here](/guides/guides/command-line).

### Environment variables

| Name                             | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY`         | [Destination of Cypress binary that's downloaded and installed](#Install-binary)                         |
| `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR`        | [Downloads the Cypress binary though a mirror server](#Mirroring)                                        |
| `CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER`           | [Changes the Cypress binary cache location](#Binary-cache)                                               |
| `CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY`             | [Location of Cypress binary at run-time](#Run-binary)                                                    |
| `CYPRESS_VERIFY_TIMEOUT`         | Overrides the timeout duration for the `verify` command. The default value is 30000.                     |
| `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE` | Allows to specify custom download url. Replaces ${endpoint}, ${platform}, ${arch} with respective values |
| ~~CYPRESS_SKIP_BINARY_INSTALL~~  | <Badge type="danger">removed</Badge> use `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0` instead                              |
| ~~CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION~~       | <Badge type="danger">removed</Badge> use `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` instead                                |

### Install binary

Using the `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` environment variable, you can control how
Cypress is installed. To override what is installed, you set
`CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` alongside the `npm install` command.

**This is helpful if you want to:**

- Install a version different than the default npm package.
  `shell CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=2.0.1 npm install cypress@2.0.3 `
- Specify an external URL (to bypass a corporate firewall).
  `shell CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=https://company.domain.com/cypress.zip npm install cypress `
- Specify a file to install locally instead of using the internet.
  `shell CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=/local/path/to/cypress.zip npm install cypress `

In all cases, the fact that the binary was installed from a custom location _is
not saved in your `package.json` file_. Every repeated installation needs to use
the same environment variable to install the same binary.

#### Skipping installation

You can also force Cypress to skip the installation of the binary application by
setting `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0`. This could be useful if you want to prevent
Cypress from downloading the Cypress binary at the time of `npm install`.

```shell
CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0 npm install
```

Now Cypress will skip its install phase once the npm module is installed.

### Binary cache

As of version `3.0`, Cypress downloads the matching Cypress binary to the global
system cache, so that the binary can be shared between projects. By default,
global cache folders are:

- **MacOS**: `~/Library/Caches/Cypress`
- **Linux**: `~/.cache/Cypress`
- **Windows**: `/AppData/Local/Cypress/Cache`

To override the default cache folder, set the environment variable
`CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER`.

```shell
CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER=~/Desktop/cypress_cache npm install
```

```shell
CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER=~/Desktop/cypress_cache npm run test
```

Cypress will automatically replace the `~` with the user's home directory. So
you can pass `CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER` as a string from CI configuration files, for
example:

```yml
environment:
  CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER: '~/.cache/Cypress'
```

See also
[Continuous Integration - Caching](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Caching)
section in the documentation.

<Alert type="warning">

`CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER` will need to exist every time cypress is launched. To
ensure this, consider exporting this environment variable. For example, in a
`.bash_profile` (MacOS, Linux), or using `RegEdit` (Windows).

</Alert>

### Run binary

Setting the environment variable `CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY` overrides where the npm
module finds the Cypress binary.

`CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY` should be a path to an already unzipped binary executable.
The Cypress commands `open`, `run`, and `verify` will then launch the provided
binary.

#### Mac

```shell
CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY=~/Downloads/Cypress.app/Contents/MacOS/Cypress cypress run
```

#### Linux

```shell
CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY=~/Downloads/Cypress/Cypress cypress run
```

#### Windows

```shell
CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY=~/Downloads/Cypress/Cypress.exe cypress run
```

<Alert type="warning">

We recommend **not exporting** the `CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY` environment variable,
since it will affect every cypress module installed on your file system.

</Alert>

### Download URLs

If you want to download a specific Cypress version for a given platform
(Operating System), you can get it from our CDN.

The download server URL is `https://download.cypress.io`.

We currently have the following downloads available:

- Windows 64-bit (`?platform=win32&arch=x64`)
- Linux 64-bit (`?platform=linux`)
- macOS 64-bit (`?platform=darwin`)

Here are the available download URLs:

See
[https://download.cypress.io/desktop.json](https://download.cypress.io/desktop.json)
for all available platforms.

| Method | URL                                   | Description                                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/desktop`                            | Download Cypress at latest version (platform auto-detected)                |
| `GET`  | `/desktop.json`                       | Returns JSON containing latest available CDN destinations                  |
| `GET`  | `/desktop?platform=p&arch=a`          | Download Cypress for a specific platform and/or architecture               |
| `GET`  | `/desktop/:version`                   | Download Cypress with a specified version                                  |
| `GET`  | `/desktop/:version?platform=p&arch=a` | Download Cypress with a specified version and platform and/or architecture |

**Example of downloading Cypress `3.0.0` for Windows 64-bit:**

```text
https://download.cypress.io/desktop/3.0.0?platform=win32&arch=x64
```

When setting
`CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE='${endpoint}/${platform}-${arch}/cypress.zip'`
environment variable, then a custom download url is used, where
${endpoint},
${platform}, ${arch} are replaced with respective values.

```text
https://download.cypress.io/desktop/3.0.0/win32-x64/cypress.zip
```

### Mirroring

If you choose to mirror the entire Cypress download site, you can specify
`CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR` to set the download server URL from
`https://download.cypress.io` to your own mirror.

For example:

```shell
CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR="https://www.example.com" cypress install
```

Cypress will then attempt to download a binary with this format:
`https://www.example.com/desktop/:version?platform=p`

### Using a custom CA

Cypress can be configured to use the `ca` and `cafile` options from your NPM
config file to download the Cypress binary.

For example, to use the CA at `/home/person/certs/ca.crt` when downloading
Cypress, add the following to your `.npmrc`:

```shell
CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_USE_CA=1
ca=/home/person/certs/ca.crt
```

### Opt out of sending exception data to Cypress

When an exception is thrown regarding Cypress, we send along the exception data
to `https://api.cypress.io`. We solely use this information to help develop a
better product.

If you would like to opt out of sending any exception data to Cypress, you can
do so by setting `CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0` in your system environment variables.

#### Opt out on Linux or macOS

To opt out of sending exception data on Linux or macOS, run the following
command in a terminal before installing Cypress:

```shell
export CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0
```

To make these changes permanent, you can add this command to your shell's
`~/.profile` (`~/.zsh_profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, etc.) to run them on every
login.

#### Opt out on Windows

To opt out of sending exception data on Windows, run the following command in
the Command Prompt before installing Cypress:

```shell
set CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0
```

To accomplish the same thing in Powershell:

```shell
$env:CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS = "0"
```

To save the `CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS` variable for use in all new shells, use
`setx`:

```shell
setx CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS 0
```

### Install pre-release version

If you would like to install a pre-release version of the Test Runner to test
out functionality that has not yet been released, here is how:

1. Open up the list of commits to `develop` on the Cypress repo:
   [https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/commits/develop](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/commits/develop)
2. Find the commit that you would like to install the pre-release version of.
   Click the comment icon (highlighted in red below):
   <DocsImage src="/img/guides/install/develop-commit-comment-link.png" alt="Example of a commit for which pre-releases are available. Comment link highlighted in red." ></DocsImage>
3. You should see several comments from the `cypress-bot` user with instructions
   for installing Cypress pre-releases. Pick the one that corresponds to your
   operating system and CPU architecture, and follow the instructions there to
   install the pre-release.

Notes on pre-releases:

- Cypress pre-releases are only available for about a month after they are
  built. Do not rely on these being available past one month.
- If you already have a pre-release or official release installed for a specific
  version of Cypress, you may need to do `cypress cache clear` before Cypress
  will install a pre-release. This also applies to installing an official
  release over a pre-release - if you have a pre-release of Cypress vX.Y.Z
  installed, the official release of Cypress vX.Y.Z will not install until you
  do `cypress cache clear`.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

#### WSL2

First, install the prerequisite packages using the command that relates to your
linux distribution ([Ubuntu/Debian](#Ubuntu-Debian) or [CentOS](#CentOS)).

We need to have an [X-server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.Org_Server) to
display the Cypress UI from the linux subsystem. There are a variety of
X-servers available, here we are going to use VcXsrv, you can use any other
similar tool.

Download [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) and install. You can
set the settings to your preference ("Multiple windows" and "Start no client"
are recommended), but on the page that lets you enable extra settings, be sure
to select "Disable access control" which is required as WSL2 has its own IP
address, which changes often.

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/vcxsrv-extra-settings.png" alt="Disable access control in vcxsrv" ></DocsImage>

In your `.bashrc` (or equivalent such as `.zshrc`) set the `DISPLAY` environment
variable.

```shell
# set DISPLAY variable to the IP automatically assigned to WSL2
export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2; exit;}'):0.0
```

To confirm `DISPLAY` variable has been set, print it out in the terminal. You
may need to restart your terminal to see this change.

```shell
echo $DISPLAY
# something like 172.17.224.1:0.0
```

The VcXsrv GUI uses [D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) to
internally communicate. After the `export DISPLAY` line in your `.bashrc`, add
the following:

```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/dbus start &> /dev/null
```

Now your user needs to be granted access to run `sudo dbus` without needing to
enter a password. To do so, use the `visido` command:

```shell
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/dbus
```

In the editor that launches, add the following line, replacing `<your_username>`
with your username (you can use the `whoami` command to print your username if
you don't know it).

```
<your_username> ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/dbus
```

Go to Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall > Inbound
Rules > New Rule.

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/windows-firewall-disable-vcxsrv.png" alt="Add rule to allow connections for vcxsrv" ></DocsImage>

Select Program and click on next. On the This program path, browse and select
path to VcxSrv. On the next page select allow the connection and click next. On
the next page, select all three options (Domain, Private, Public).

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/rule-application-selection.png" alt="Select inbound rule application cases for vcxsrv" ></DocsImage>

Give the rule a suitable name and description and click finish. WSL2 should now
be able to open a GUI from shell.
