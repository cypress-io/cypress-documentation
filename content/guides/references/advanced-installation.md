## Install binary

Using the `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` environment variable, you can control how
Cypress is installed. To override what is installed, you set
`CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` alongside the `npm install` command.

**This is helpful if you want to:**

- Install a version different than the default npm package.
  `shell CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=2.0.1 npm install cypress@2.0.3 `
- Specify an external URL (to bypass a corporate firewall).
  `shell CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=https://company.domain.com/cypress.zip npm install cypress `
- Specify a file to install locally instead of using the internet.
  `shell CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=/local/path/to/cypress.zip npm install cypress `

In all cases, the fact that the binary was installed from a custom location _is
not saved in your `package.json` file_. Every repeated installation needs to use
the same environment variable to install the same binary.

### Skipping installation

You can also force Cypress to skip the installation of the binary application by
setting `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0`. This could be useful if you want to prevent
Cypress from downloading the Cypress binary at the time of `npm install`.

```shell
CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0 npm install
```

Now Cypress will skip its install phase once the npm module is installed.

## Binary cache

As of version `3.0`, Cypress downloads the matching Cypress binary to the global
system cache, so that the binary can be shared between projects. By default,
global cache folders are:

- **MacOS**: `~/Library/Caches/Cypress`
- **Linux**: `~/.cache/Cypress`
- **Windows**: `/AppData/Local/Cypress/Cache`

To override the default cache folder, set the environment variable
`CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER`.

```shell
CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER=~/Desktop/cypress_cache npm install
```

```shell
CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER=~/Desktop/cypress_cache npm run test
```

Cypress will automatically replace the `~` with the user's home directory. So
you can pass `CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER` as a string from CI configuration files, for
example:

```yml
environment:
  CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER: '~/.cache/Cypress'
```

See also
[Continuous Integration - Caching](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Caching)
section in the documentation.

<Alert type="warning">

`CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER` will need to exist every time cypress is launched. To
ensure this, consider exporting this environment variable. For example, in a
`.bash_profile` (MacOS, Linux), or using `RegEdit` (Windows).

</Alert>

## Run binary

Setting the environment variable `CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY` overrides where the npm
module finds the Cypress binary.

`CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY` should be a path to an already unzipped binary executable.
The Cypress commands `open`, `run`, and `verify` will then launch the provided
binary.

### Mac

```shell
CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY=~/Downloads/Cypress.app/Contents/MacOS/Cypress cypress run
```

### Linux

```shell
CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY=~/Downloads/Cypress/Cypress cypress run
```

### Windows

```shell
CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY=~/Downloads/Cypress/Cypress.exe cypress run
```

<Alert type="warning">

We recommend **not exporting** the `CYPRESS_RUN_BINARY` environment variable,
since it will affect every cypress module installed on your file system.

</Alert>

## Download URLs

If you want to download a specific Cypress version for a given platform
(Operating System), you can get it from our CDN.

The download server URL is `https://download.cypress.io`.

We currently have the following downloads available:

- Windows 64-bit (`?platform=win32&arch=x64`)
- Linux 64-bit (`?platform=linux`)
- macOS 64-bit (`?platform=darwin`)

Here are the available download URLs:

See
[https://download.cypress.io/desktop.json](https://download.cypress.io/desktop.json)
for all available platforms.

| Method | URL                                   | Description                                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/desktop`                            | Download Cypress at latest version (platform auto-detected)                |
| `GET`  | `/desktop.json`                       | Returns JSON containing latest available CDN destinations                  |
| `GET`  | `/desktop?platform=p&arch=a`          | Download Cypress for a specific platform and/or architecture               |
| `GET`  | `/desktop/:version`                   | Download Cypress with a specified version                                  |
| `GET`  | `/desktop/:version?platform=p&arch=a` | Download Cypress with a specified version and platform and/or architecture |

**Example of downloading Cypress `3.0.0` for Windows 64-bit:**

```text
https://download.cypress.io/desktop/3.0.0?platform=win32&arch=x64
```

When setting
`CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE='${endpoint}/${platform}-${arch}/cypress.zip'`
environment variable, then a custom download url is used, where
${endpoint},
${platform}, ${arch} are replaced with respective values.

```text
https://download.cypress.io/desktop/3.0.0/win32-x64/cypress.zip
```

## Mirroring

If you choose to mirror the entire Cypress download site, you can specify
`CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR` to set the download server URL from
`https://download.cypress.io` to your own mirror.

For example:

```shell
CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR="https://www.example.com" cypress install
```

Cypress will then attempt to download a binary with this format:
`https://www.example.com/desktop/:version?platform=p`

## Using a custom CA

Cypress can be configured to use the `ca` and `cafile` options from your NPM
config file to download the Cypress binary.

For example, to use the CA at `/home/person/certs/ca.crt` when downloading
Cypress, add the following to your `.npmrc`:

```shell
CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_USE_CA=1
ca=/home/person/certs/ca.crt
```

## Opt out of sending exception data to Cypress

When an exception is thrown regarding Cypress, we send along the exception data
to `https://api.cypress.io`. We solely use this information to help develop a
better product.

If you would like to opt out of sending any exception data to Cypress, you can
do so by setting `CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0` in your system environment variables.

### Opt out on Linux or macOS

To opt out of sending exception data on Linux or macOS, run the following
command in a terminal before installing Cypress:

```shell
export CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0
```

To make these changes permanent, you can add this command to your shell's
`~/.profile` (`~/.zsh_profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, etc.) to run them on every
login.

### Opt out on Windows

To opt out of sending exception data on Windows, run the following command in
the Command Prompt before installing Cypress:

```shell
set CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0
```

To accomplish the same thing in PowerShell:

```shell
$env:CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS = "0"
```

To save the `CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS` variable for use in all new shells, use
`setx`:

```shell
setx CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS 0
```

## Install pre-release version

If you would like to install a pre-release version of the Cypress App to test
out functionality that has not yet been released, here is how:

1. Open up the list of commits to `develop` on the Cypress repo:
   [https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/commits/develop](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/commits/develop)
2. Find the commit that you would like to install the pre-release version of.
   Click the comment icon (highlighted in red below):
   <DocsImage src="/img/guides/install/develop-commit-comment-link.png" alt="Example of a commit for which pre-releases are available. Comment link highlighted in red."></DocsImage>
3. You should see several comments from the `cypress-bot` user with instructions
   for installing Cypress pre-releases. Pick the one that corresponds to your
   operating system and CPU architecture, and follow the instructions there to
   install the pre-release.

Cypress pre-releases are only available for 60 days after they are built. Do not
rely on these being available past 60 days.

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

First, install the prerequisite packages using the command that relates to your
linux distribution ([Ubuntu/Debian](#Ubuntu-Debian) or [CentOS](#CentOS)).

We need to have an [X-server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.Org_Server) to
display the Cypress UI from the linux subsystem. There are a variety of
X-servers available, here we are going to use VcXsrv, you can use any other
similar tool.

Download [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) and install. You can
set the settings to your preference ("Multiple windows" and "Start no client"
are recommended), but on the page that lets you enable extra settings, be sure
to select "Disable access control" which is required as WSL2 has its own IP
address, which changes often.

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/install/vcxsrv-extra-settings.png" alt="Disable access control in vcxsrv"></DocsImage>

In your `.bashrc` (or equivalent such as `.zshrc`) set the `DISPLAY` environment
variable.

```shell
# set DISPLAY variable to the IP automatically assigned to WSL2
export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2; exit;}'):0.0
```

To confirm `DISPLAY` variable has been set, print it out in the terminal. You
may need to restart your terminal to see this change.

```shell
echo $DISPLAY
# something like 172.17.224.1:0.0
```

The VcXsrv GUI uses [D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) to
internally communicate. After the `export DISPLAY` line in your `.bashrc`, add
the following:

```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/dbus start &> /dev/null
```

Now your user needs to be granted access to run `sudo dbus` without needing to
enter a password. To do so, use the `visido` command:

```shell
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/dbus
```

In the editor that launches, add the following line, replacing `<your_username>`
with your username (you can use the `whoami` command to print your username if
you don't know it).

```
<your_username> ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/dbus
```

Go to Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall > Inbound
Rules > New Rule.

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/install/windows-firewall-disable-vcxsrv.png" alt="Add rule to allow connections for vcxsrv"></DocsImage>

Select Program and click on next. On the This program path, browse and select
path to VcxSrv. On the next page select allow the connection and click next. On
the next page, select all three options (Domain, Private, Public).

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/install/rule-application-selection.png" alt="Select inbound rule application cases for vcxsrv"></DocsImage>

Give the rule a suitable name and description and click finish. WSL2 should now
be able to open a GUI from shell.
