It is possible in Cypress to configure CA and client certificates to use within tests on a per URL basis.

<strong class="alert-header">How to specify client certificate info</strong>

This document is only a reference to offer guidance on how to specify certificate file paths for given test URLs. For information on the content and purpose of such files, please search elsewhere as this is not within the scope of Cypress documentation.

## Structure within JSON config file

To configure CA / client certificates within your cypress.env.json, you should add a section at the top level something like:

```
  "clientCertificates": [
    {
      "url": "https://a.host.com",
      "ca": [
          "certs/ca.pem"
      ],
      "certs": [
        {
          "cert": "certs/cert.pem",
          "key": "certs/private.key",
          "passphrase": "certs/pem-passphrase.txt"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "url": "https://b.host.com/a_base_route/**",
      "ca": [],
      "certs": [
        {
          "pfx": "/home/tester/certs/cert.pfx",
          "passphrase": "/home/tester/certs/pfx-passphrase.txt"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "url": "https://a.host.*.com/",
      "ca": [],
      "certs": [
        {
          "pfx": "certs/cert.pfx",
          "passphrase": "certs/pfx-passphrase.txt"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
**Notes:**
 * The passhprase value must always point to a text file containing the phrase, not the phrase itself. 
 * URL is a required value for each certificate 'block' within the config
 * For any given URL block, you *must* specify either a PFX file, *or* a PEM format cert/key pair of files, but not both. 
 * As you can see above, wildcards are supported for the url value, but no other values. These wildcards must follow Javascript minimatch (https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) rules
