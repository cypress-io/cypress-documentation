## Return Values

New users to Cypress may initially find it challenging to work with the
asynchronous nature of our APIs.

<Alert type="success">

<strong class="alert-header">Do not worry!</strong>

There are many ways to reference, compare and utilize the objects that Cypress
commands yield you.

Once you get the hang of async code you'll realize you can do everything you
could do synchronously, without your code doing any backflips.

This guide explores many common patterns for writing good Cypress code that can
handle even the most complex situations.

</Alert>

Asynchronous APIs are here to stay in JavaScript. They are found everywhere in
modern code. In fact, most new browser APIs are asynchronous and many core Node
modules are asynchronous as well.

The patterns we'll explore below are useful in and outside of Cypress.

The first and most important concept you should recognize is...

<Alert type="danger">

<strong class="alert-header">Return Values</strong>

**You cannot assign or work with the return values** of any Cypress command.
Commands are enqueued and run asynchronously.

</Alert>

```js
// this won't work the way you think it does
const button = cy.get('button')
const form = cy.get('form')

button.click()
```

### Closures

To access what each Cypress command yields you use
[`.then()`](/api/commands/then).

```js
cy.get('button').then(($btn) => {
  // $btn is the object that the previous
  // command yielded us
})
```

If you're familiar with
[native Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)
the Cypress `.then()` works the same way. You can continue to nest more Cypress
commands inside of the `.then()`.

Each nested command has access to the work done in previous commands. This ends
up reading very nicely.

```js
cy.get('button').then(($btn) => {

  // store the button's text
  const txt = $btn.text()

  // submit a form
  cy.get('form').submit()

  // compare the two buttons' text
  // and make sure they are different
  cy.get('button').should(($btn2) => {
    expect($btn2.text()).not.to.eq(txt)
  })
})

// these commands run after all of the
// other previous commands have finished
cy.get(...).find(...).should(...)
```

The commands outside of the `.then()` will not run until all of the nested
commands finish.

<Alert type="info">

By using callback functions we've created a
[closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).
Closures enable us to keep references around to refer to work done in previous
commands.

</Alert>

### Debugging

Using `.then()` functions is an excellent opportunity to use
[`debugger`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger).
This can help you understand the order in which commands are run. This also
enables you to inspect the objects that Cypress yields you in each command.

```js
cy.get('button').then(($btn) => {
  // inspect $btn <object>
  debugger

  cy.get('[data-testid="countries"]')
    .select('USA')
    .then(($select) => {
      // inspect $select <object>
      debugger

      cy.clock().then(($clock) => {
        // inspect $clock <object>
        debugger

        $btn // is still available
        $select // is still available too
      })
    })
})
```

### Variables

Typically in Cypress you hardly need to ever use `const`, `let`, or `var`. When
using closures you'll always have access to the objects that were yielded to you
without assigning them.

The one exception to this rule is when you are dealing with mutable objects
(that change state). When things change state you often want to compare an
object's previous value to the next value.

Here's a great use case for a `const`.

```html
<button>increment</button>

you clicked button <span data-testid="num">0</span> times
```

```js
// app code
let count = 0

$('button').on('click', () => {
  $('[data-testid="num"]').text((count += 1))
})
```

```js
// cypress test code
cy.get('[data-testid="num"]').then(($span) => {
  // capture what num is right now
  const num1 = parseFloat($span.text())

  cy.get('button')
    .click()
    .then(() => {
      // now capture it again
      const num2 = parseFloat($span.text())

      // make sure it's what we expected
      expect(num2).to.eq(num1 + 1)
    })
})
```

The reason for using `const` is because the `$span` object is mutable. Whenever
you have mutable objects and you're trying to compare them, you'll need to store
their values. Using `const` is a perfect way to do that.

## Aliases

Using `.then()` callback functions to access the previous command values is
great&mdash;but what happens when you're running code in hooks like `before` or
`beforeEach`?

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.get('button').then(($btn) => {
    const text = $btn.text()
  })
})

it('does not have access to text', () => {
  // how do we get access to text ?!?!
})
```

How will we get access to `text`?

We could make our code do some ugly backflips using `let` to get access to it.

<Alert type="danger">

<strong class="alert-header">Do not do this</strong>

This code below is just for demonstration.

</Alert>

```js
describe('a suite', () => {
  // this creates a closure around
  // 'text' so we can access it
  let text

  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.get('button').then(($btn) => {
      // redefine text reference
      text = $btn.text()
    })
  })

  it('does have access to text', () => {
    // now text is available to us
    // but this is not a great solution :(
    text
  })
})
```

Fortunately, you don't have to make your code do backflips. With Cypress, we can
better handle these situations.

<Alert type="success">

<strong class="alert-header">Introducing Aliases</strong>

Aliases are a powerful construct in Cypress that have many uses. We'll explore
each of their capabilities below.

At first, we'll use them to share objects between your hooks and your tests.

</Alert>

### Sharing Context

Sharing context is the simplest way to use aliases.

To alias something you'd like to share use the [`.as()`](/api/commands/as)
command.

Let's look at our previous example with aliases.

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  // alias the $btn.text() as 'text'
  cy.get('button').invoke('text').as('text')
})

it('has access to text', function () {
  this.text // is now available
})
```

Under the hood, aliasing basic objects and primitives utilizes Mocha's shared
[`context`](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/wiki/Shared-Behaviours) object:
that is, aliases are available as `this.*`.

Mocha automatically shares contexts for us across all applicable hooks for each
test. Additionally these aliases and properties are automatically cleaned up
after each test.

```js
describe('parent', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.wrap('one').as('a')
  })

  context('child', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      cy.wrap('two').as('b')
    })

    describe('grandchild', () => {
      beforeEach(() => {
        cy.wrap('three').as('c')
      })

      it('can access all aliases as properties', function () {
        expect(this.a).to.eq('one') // true
        expect(this.b).to.eq('two') // true
        expect(this.c).to.eq('three') // true
      })
    })
  })
})
```

#### Accessing Fixtures:

The most common use case for sharing context is when dealing with
[`cy.fixture()`](/api/commands/fixture).

Often times you may load a fixture in a `beforeEach` hook but want to utilize
the values in your tests.

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  // alias the users fixtures
  cy.fixture('users.json').as('users')
})

it('utilize users in some way', function () {
  // access the users property
  const user = this.users[0]

  // make sure the header contains the first
  // user's name
  cy.get('header').should('contain', user.name)
})
```

<Alert type="danger">

<strong class="alert-header">Watch out for async commands</strong>

Do not forget that **Cypress commands are async**!

You cannot use a `this.*` reference until the `.as()` command runs.

</Alert>

```js
it('is not using aliases correctly', function () {
  cy.fixture('users.json').as('users')

  // nope this won't work
  //
  // this.users is not defined
  // because the 'as' command has only
  // been enqueued - it has not run yet
  const user = this.users[0]
})
```

The same principles we introduced many times before apply to this situation. If
you want to access what a command yields you have to do it in a closure using a
[`.then()`](/api/commands/then).

```js
// yup all good
cy.fixture('users.json').then((users) => {
  // now we can avoid the alias altogether
  // and use a callback function
  const user = users[0]

  // passes
  cy.get('header').should('contain', user.name)
})
```

#### Avoiding the use of `this`

<Alert type="warning">

<strong class="alert-header">Arrow Functions</strong>

Accessing aliases as properties with `this.*` will not work if you use
[arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
for your tests or hooks.

This is why all of our examples use the regular `function () {}` syntax as
opposed to the lambda "fat arrow" syntax `() => {}`.

</Alert>

Instead of using the `this.*` syntax, there is another way to access aliases.

The [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get) command is capable of accessing aliases with
a special syntax using the `@` character:

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  // alias the users fixtures
  cy.fixture('users.json').as('users')
})

it('utilize users in some way', function () {
  // use the special '@' syntax to access aliases
  // which avoids the use of 'this'
  cy.get('@users').then((users) => {
    // access the users argument
    const user = users[0]

    // make sure the header contains the first
    // user's name
    cy.get('header').should('contain', user.name)
  })
})
```

By using [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get) we avoid the use of `this`.

Keep in mind that there are use cases for both approaches because they have
different ergonomics.

When using `this.users` we have access to it synchronously, whereas when using
`cy.get('@users')` it becomes an asynchronous command.

You can think of the `cy.get('@users')` as doing the same thing as
[`cy.wrap(this.users)`](/api/commands/wrap).

### Elements

Aliases have other special characteristics when being used with DOM elements.

After you alias DOM elements, you can then later access them for reuse.

```javascript
// alias all of the tr's found in the table as 'rows'
cy.get('table').find('tr').as('rows')
```

Internally, Cypress has made a reference to the `<tr>` collection returned as
the alias "rows". To reference these same "rows" later, you can use the
[`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get) command.

```javascript
// Cypress returns the reference to the <tr>'s
// which allows us to continue to chain commands
// finding the 1st row.
cy.get('@rows').first().click()
```

Because we've used the `@` character in [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get), instead
of querying the DOM for elements, [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get) looks for an
existing alias called `rows` and returns the reference (if it finds it).

#### Stale Elements:

In many single-page JavaScript applications the DOM re-renders parts of the
application constantly. If you alias DOM elements that have been removed from
the DOM by the time you call [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get) with the alias,
Cypress automatically re-queries the DOM to find these elements again.

```html
<ul id="todos">
  <li>
    Walk the dog
    <button class="edit">edit</button>
  </li>
  <li>
    Feed the cat
    <button class="edit">edit</button>
  </li>
</ul>
```

Let's imagine when we click the `.edit` button that our `<li>` is re-rendered in
the DOM. Instead of displaying the edit button it instead displays an
`<input />` text field allowing you to edit the todo. The previous `<li>` has
been _completely_ removed from the DOM and a new `<li>` is rendered in its
place.

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="todos"] li').first().as('firstTodo')
cy.get('@firstTodo').find('.edit').click()
cy.get('@firstTodo')
  .should('have.class', 'editing')
  .find('input')
  .type('Clean the kitchen')
```

When we reference `@firstTodo`, Cypress checks to see if all of the elements it
is referencing are still in the DOM. If they are, it returns those existing
elements. If they aren't, Cypress replays the commands leading up to the alias
definition.

In our case it would re-issue the commands: `cy.get('#todos li').first()`.
Everything works because the new `<li>` is found.

<Alert type="warning">

_Usually_, replaying previous commands will return what you expect, but not
always. It is recommended that you **alias elements as soon as possible**
instead of further down a chain of commands.

- `cy.get('nav header [data-testid="user"]').as('user')`
  <Icon name="check-circle" color="green"></Icon> (good)
- `cy.get('nav').find('header').find('[data-testid="user"]').as('user')`
  <Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> (bad)

When in doubt, you can _always_ issue a regular [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get)
to query for the elements again.

</Alert>

### Intercepts

Aliases can also be used with [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept).
Aliasing your intercepted routes enables you to:

- ensure your application makes the intended requests
- wait for your server to send the response
- access the actual request object for assertions

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/core-concepts/v10/aliasing-routes.png" alt="Alias commands"></DocsImage>

Here's an example of aliasing an intercepted route and waiting on it to
complete.

```js
cy.intercept('POST', '/users', { id: 123 }).as('postUser')

cy.get('form').submit()

cy.wait('@postUser').then(({ request }) => {
  expect(request.body).to.have.property('name', 'Brian')
})

cy.contains('Successfully created user: Brian')
```

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">New to Cypress?</strong>

[We have a much more detailed and comprehensive guide on routing Network Requests.](/guides/guides/network-requests)

</Alert>

### Requests

Aliases can also be used with [requests](/api/commands/request).

Here's an example of aliasing a request and accessing its properties later.

```js
cy.request('https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/comments').as('comments')

// other test code here

cy.get('@comments').should((response) => {
  if (response.status === 200) {
      expect(response).to.have.property('duration')
    } else {
      // whatever you want to check here
    }
  })
})
```

### Aliases are reset before each test

**Note:** all aliases are reset before each test. A common user mistake is to
create aliases using the `before` hook. Such aliases work in the first test
only!

```js
// 🚨 THIS EXAMPLE DOES NOT WORK
before(() => {
  // notice this alias is created just once using "before" hook
  cy.wrap('some value').as('exampleValue')
})

it('works in the first test', () => {
  cy.get('@exampleValue').should('equal', 'some value')
})

// NOTE the second test is failing because the alias is reset
it('does not exist in the second test', () => {
  // there is not alias because it is created once before
  // the first test, and is reset before the second test
  cy.get('@exampleValue').should('equal', 'some value')
})
```

The solution is to create the aliases before each test using the `beforeEach`
hook

```js
// ✅ THE CORRECT EXAMPLE
beforeEach(() => {
  // we will create a new alias before each test
  cy.wrap('some value').as('exampleValue')
})

it('works in the first test', () => {
  cy.get('@exampleValue').should('equal', 'some value')
})

it('works in the second test', () => {
  cy.get('@exampleValue').should('equal', 'some value')
})
```
