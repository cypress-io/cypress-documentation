## User requests

Users can "request" access to a given organization. If a developer on your team
has access to Cypress and your project's source code - they can request to be
given access to your organization. This means instead of you having to invite
team members up front, they can request access and you can choose to accept or
deny them access.

## User updates

Changes can be made to both the primary email address associated with your
Dashboard account and the email address for billing notifications.

For updating the primary email address associated with your Dashboard, click
your Profile picture in the upper left corner of the Organizations page. Select
**Manage Profile**. Go to the **Email** field and select your preferred email
address. _Note: The email list is limited to emails provided by login provider._

If you would like to update the billing email address, that can be done via the
**Billing & Usage** page within the [Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard)
or you contact them directly at [billing@cypress.io](mailto:billing@cypress.io).
