title: Flaky Test Management
---

By enabling [test retries](/guides/guides/test-retries), the Cypress Dashboard
can detect, flag, and track flaky tests from your recorded Cypress test runs in
your CI/CD pipeline.

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">What is a flaky test?</strong>

A test is considered to be **flaky** when it can pass and fail across multiple
retry attempts without any code changes.

For example, a test is executed and fails, then the test is executed again,
without any change to the code, but this time it passes.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">What are test retries?</strong>

Cypress has the ability to automatically retry failed tests to mitigate flaky
tests from failing entire test runs or CI builds.

Test retries is **disabled by default**, and you can
[enable it within the Cypress configuration](/guides/guides/test-retries#Configure-Test-Retries).

## Flake Detection

<Alert type="success">

<strong class="alert-header"><Icon name="star"></Icon> Premium Dashboard
Feature</strong>

**Test flake detection** is available to users with a
[Team Dashboard plan](https://cypress.io/pricing).

</Alert>

One way to battle flaky tests is to detect and monitor them as they occur in an
organized and methodical manner such that you can assess their severity to
assist with prioritizing their fix.

<Alert type="warning">

<strong class="alert-header">Test Retries & Flake Detection</strong>

Test retries is the _fundamental mechanism_ that enables the detection of flaky
tests by the Cypress Dashboard. Therefore, **enabling
[test retries](/guides/guides/test-retries#Configure-Test-Retries) is required**
to take advantage of any flaky test management feature provided by the Cypress
Dashboard.

</Alert>

### Flagging Flaky Tests

Test runs with flaky tests will be flagged with the number of flaky of tests
within the Dashboard "Latest runs" page. Flaky tests runs can also be filtered
in and out via the "Flaky" filter within this page.

Any failure across multiple test run attempts triggered by test retrying will
result in a given test case to be flagged as flaky.

### Flaky Test Analytics

<Alert type="success">

<strong class="alert-header"><Icon name="star"></Icon> Premium Dashboard
Feature</strong>

**Test flake analytics** are available to users with a
[Team Dashboard plan](https://cypress.io/pricing).

</Alert>

The flaky tests analytics page provides a birds-eye-view on the state of flake
within your project by showing:

- Plot of the **number of flaky tests over time**.
- Overall **flakiness level** of the entire project.
- **Number of flake tests** grouped by their severity.
- Filterable **log of all flaky test** cases ordered by severity.

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">Flake Severity</strong>

Test flake **severity** is determined by the frequency of flake or the **flake
rate** of a given test. Flake severity level can be used to prioritize the work
needed to resolve flake issues.

</Alert>

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/flaky-test-management/flake-analytics.png" alt="Flaky tests analytics" ></DocsImage>

Selecting any of the flaky test cases in the analytics page will reveal a test
case details panel that shows:

- Historical log of latest flaky runs
- Most common errors across the runs of the test case
- Related test case changelog
- Plot of failure rate and flaky rate over time.

All these test case level details provide deeper context around the occurrences
of flake over time to assist with debugging the root cause.

### Failure Rate vs Flake Rate

It is important to understand the distinction between failure rate and flake
rate when test retries is enabled. These two metrics are tracked over time for
each flaky test case within the flaky tests analytics page:

A test case flagged as flaky could have still passed after multiple test retry
attempts. The test result status of individual test retry attempts is separate
and distinct from the final test status.

For example, a project is configured to retry failing tests up to 3 times. The
first two attempts fail, but the last and third attempt passes, resulting in a
final status of passing.

With this concept in mind, it is possible to always have zero final failure rate
while exhibiting flake as demonstrated below:

## Flake Alerting

<Alert type="success">

<strong class="alert-header"><Icon name="star"></Icon> Premium Dashboard
Feature</strong>

**Test flake alerting** is available to users with a
[Team Dashboard plan](https://cypress.io/pricing).

</Alert>

The Dashboard can provide alerts via
[GitHub](/guides/dashboard/github-integration) and
[Slack integrations](/guides/dashboard/slack-integration), to further assist
with staying on top of flake occurrences.

### GitHub

Flake alerting via GitHub PR comments and status checks can be enabled within a
project's GitHub integration settings:

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/flaky-test-management/gh-flake.png" alt="GitHub flake alert settings" ></DocsImage>

After enabling GitHub flake alerting, GitHub PR comments will show the number of
flaky tests associated with the PR within the test summary, and include a
"Flakiness" section highlighting the specific tests that flaked.

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/flaky-test-management/flake-pr-comment.png" alt="GitHub flake alert pr comment" ></DocsImage>

### Slack

Flake alerting via Slack can be enabled within Slack integration settings:

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/flaky-test-management/slack-flake.png" alt="Slack flake alert settings" ></DocsImage>

After enabling Slack alerts, the Dashboard will send Slack messages whenever
flaky tests are detected:
