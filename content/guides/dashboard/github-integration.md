title: GitHub Integration
---

The [Cypress Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) can integrate your
Cypress tests with your GitHub workflow via commit
[status checks](#Status-checks) and
[pull request comments](#Pull-request-comments). A project first needs to be
[setup to record](/guides/dashboard/projects) to the Cypress Dashboard to use
GitHub integration.

<Alert type="warning">

GitHub Integration is dependent on your CI environment reliably providing commit
SHA data (typically via an environment variable). This is not a problem for most
users, but if you are facing GitHub integration issues with your CI setup,
please make sure the git information is being sent properly by following
[these guidelines](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information).
If you are still facing issues after this, please
[contact us](mailto:hello@cypress.io).

## Install the Cypress GitHub app

Before you can enable GitHub integration for your Cypress projects, you must
first install the Cypress GitHub App. You can start the GitHub App installation
process via your organization's settings page or a project's settings page in
the [Cypress Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard).

### Install via organization integration settings

1. Go to the Dashboard
   [Organizations page](https://dashboard.cypress.io/organizations) or open the
   organization switcher.
2. Select the organization you wish to integrate with a GitHub account or GitHub
   organization.
   <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/select-cypress-organization.png" alt="Select an organization" width-600 ></DocsImage>
3. Visit the selected organization's **Integrations** page via the side
   navigation.
   <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/navigate-to-organization-integrations.png" alt="Install Cypress GitHub from Integrations" ></DocsImage>
4. Click the **Install GitHub Integration** button.

### Install via project settings

1. Select your organization in the organization switcher.
   <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/select-cypress-organization.png" alt="Select an organization" width-600 ></DocsImage>
2. Select the project you wish to integrate with a GitHub repository.
   <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/select-cypress-project.png" alt="Select a project" ></DocsImage>
3. Go to the project's settings page.
   <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/visit-project-settings.png" alt="Visit project settings" ></DocsImage>
4. Scroll down to the **GitHub Integration** section.
5. Click the **Install the Cypress GitHub App** button.
   <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/install-github-cypress-app-project-settings.png" alt="Install GitHub Cypress App" ></DocsImage>

### Cypress GitHub app installation process

Once you've started the GitHub App installation process
[via a Cypress organization's settings](#Install-via-organization-integration-settings)
or [a project's settings](#Install-via-project-settings), you will be directed
to GitHub.com to complete the installation:

1. Select the desired GitHub organization or account to integrate with your
   Cypress Dashboard organization.
   <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/select-gh-org.jpg" alt="Select a GitHub organization"  ></DocsImage>

2. Choose to associate **All repositories** or only select GitHub repositories
   with your Cypress GitHub App installation.

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/select-all-gh-repos.jpg" alt="Select All GitHub repositories" ></DocsImage>

  <Alert type="info">

All current and _future_ repositories will be included with this installation if
you choose **All repositories**.

</Alert>

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/select-gh-repos.jpg" alt="Select specific GitHub repositories" ></DocsImage>

3. Click the **Install** button to complete the installation.

## Enabling GitHub integration for a project

After completing the Cypress GitHub App installation for your organization you
can now enable GitHub Integration for _any_ Cypress project.

1. Go to the project's settings page.
   <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/visit-project-settings.png" alt="Visit project settings" ></DocsImage>

2. Scroll down to the GitHub Integration section. <Alert type="info">

   You can quickly get to a project's GitHub Integrations settings, by clicking
   on the **Configure** link of the desired project within an organization's
   Integrations page:

</Alert>

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/org-settings-with-no-enabled-projects.png" alt="Org GitHub Integration settings"></DocsImage>

3. Select a GitHub repository to associate with the project.

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/project-settings-repo-selection.png" alt="Associate GitHub repo with Cypress project"></DocsImage>

Once a GitHub repository is associated with a Cypress project, the GitHub
integration will be immediately enabled:
<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/project-settings-selected-repo.png" alt="GitHub integration enabled for Cypress project"></DocsImage>

You can also see all GitHub Integration enabled Cypress projects within your
organizations **Integrations** page:
<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/org-settings-with-projects.png" alt="Integrations page"></DocsImage>

## Status checks

If status checks are enabled within a project's GitHub integration settings, the
Cypress Dashboard will report Cypress test statuses to GitHub for related
commits.
[Status checks](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-status-checks) help
prevent merging a commit or pull-request into the rest of your codebase until
all your Cypress tests have passed.

The Cypress GitHub App reports commit status checks in two separate styles:

- **One check per
  [run group](/guides/guides/parallelization#Grouping-test-runs).**
  <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/status-checks-per-group-failed.png" alt="Status checks per group"></DocsImage>

- **Or one check per spec file.**
  <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/status-checks-per-spec.png" alt="Status checks per spec"></DocsImage>

Each status check will report the number of test failures or passes, and the
associated **Details** link will direct you to the test run's page within the
Cypress Dashboard to help you dig deeper into the problem via error messages,
stack traces, screenshots, and video recordings:
<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/dashboard-fail-tab.png" alt="Cypress Dashboard failure tab" ></DocsImage>

### Disable status checks

GitHub status checks are optional, and can be disabled within a project's GitHub
integration settings:
<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/status-check-settings.png" alt="Status checks settings" ></DocsImage>

## Pull request comments

The Cypress GitHub App can provide detailed test information within pull
requests via comments that include:

- **Run statistics, such as tests passed, failed, skipped, and over-limit.**
- **Run context details:**
  - The associated Cypress project
  - Final run status (passed, failed, etc)
  - Commit SHA linking to the GitHub commit
  - The time the run started and finished as well as the duration.
  - Operating system version and browser version.
- **Run failures:**
  - The first 10 failures are displayed with a link to more.
  - Each failed test links back to the associated failure within the Cypress
    Dashboard.
  - Screenshot thumbnails are also provided with each failure to conveniently
    provide context.

An example of a Cypress pull-request comment can be seen below:

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/pr-comment-fail.jpg" alt="Cypress GitHub App PR comment" ></DocsImage>

### Disable PR comments

PR comments and failure screenshot thumbnails are optional, and can be disabled
if not needed within a project's GitHub Integration settings:
<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/pr-comments-settings.png" alt="Status checks settings" ></DocsImage>

## Uninstall the Cypress GitHub app

You can uninstall the Cypress GitHub app from GitHub by performing the following
steps:

1. Go into your organization's **Settings** from within GitHub.
2. Click on **Installed GitHub Apps**.
3. Click **Configure** beside the Cypress app.
4. Click **Uninstall** below the "Uninstall Cypress" section.
