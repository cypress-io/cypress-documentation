title: GitHub Integration
---

The [Cypress Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) can integrate your
Cypress tests with your GitHub workflow via commit
[status checks](#Status-checks) and
[pull request comments](#Pull-request-comments). A project first needs to be
[setup to record](/guides/dashboard/projects) to the Cypress Dashboard to use
GitHub integration.

<Alert type="warning">

GitHub Integration is dependent on your CI environment reliably providing commit
SHA data (typically via an environment variable). This is not a problem for most
users, but if you are facing GitHub integration issues with your CI setup,
please make sure the git information is being sent properly by following
[these guidelines](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information).
If you are still facing issues after this, please
[contact us](mailto:hello@cypress.io).

GitHub Enterprise integration is included in our
[Business and Enterprise paid pricing plans](https://www.cypress.io/pricing).

</Alert>

To configure the Dashboard integration for your GitHub Enterprise site, first
follow the instructions to
[install via organization integration settings](#Install-via-organization-integration-settings)
below, then skip to
[Cypress GitHub Enterprise app installation](#Cypress-GitHub-Enterprise-app-installation-process),
and finally
[enable integration for a project](#Enabling-GitHub-integration-for-a-project).

## Install the Cypress GitHub app

Before you can enable GitHub integration for your Cypress projects, you must

process via your organization's settings page or a project's settings page in
the [Cypress Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard).

### Install via organization integration settings

1. Go to the Dashboard
   [Organizations page](https://dashboard.cypress.io/organizations) or open the
   organization switcher.
2. Select the organization you wish to integrate with a GitHub account or GitHub
   organization.

them into the Dashboard, and complete the activation process.

1. With your Dashboard organization's GitHub Enterprise page open, open a new
   tab or browser window and browse to your GitHub Enterprise site. Navigate to
   your GitHub organization → **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **GitHub
   Apps**. Do **NOT** go to **OAuth Apps**. Click the **New GitHub App** button.

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/ghe/ghe-01.png" alt="Create new GitHub App" id="cypress-github-enterprise-app-installation-process-1"></DocsImage>

2. Complete the **Register new GitHub app** section.
   - Enter a **GitHub App name**. Name may contain only dashes, letters and
     numbers, **no spaces**.

6. Returning to the Cypress Dashboard GitHub Enterprise Integration
   configuration screen, populate the following values from your new GitHub App.
   - Copy the root URL of your GitHub Enterprise site to the Cypress **GitHub
     Enterprise Server URL** field.
   - Copy the **App ID** to the Cypress **GitHub Enterprise App ID** field.

10. Finally you will be returned to the Dashboard. Congratulations, you have
    installed the Cypress Dashboard GitHub Enterprise integration! You are now
    ready to configure a GitHub Integration for a project.

## Enabling GitHub integration for a project

After completing the Cypress GitHub App installation for your organization you
can now enable GitHub Integration for _any_ Cypress project.

1. Go to the project's settings page.
   <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/visit-project-settings.png" alt="Visit project settings" ></DocsImage>

2. Scroll down to the GitHub Integration or GitHub Enterprise Integration
   section.

<Alert type="info">
   You can quickly get to a project's GitHub Integrations settings, by clicking
   on the <strong>Configure</strong> link of the desired project within an organization's
   Integrations page:
</Alert>

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/org-settings-with-no-enabled-projects.png" alt="Org GitHub Integration settings"></DocsImage>

3. Select a GitHub repository to associate with the project.

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/project-settings-repo-selection.png" alt="Associate GitHub repo with Cypress project"></DocsImage>

Once a GitHub repository is associated with a Cypress project, the GitHub
integration will be immediately enabled:
<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/project-settings-selected-repo.png" alt="GitHub integration enabled for Cypress project"></DocsImage>

You can also see all GitHub Integration enabled Cypress projects within your
organizations **Integrations** page:
<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/org-settings-with-projects.png" alt="Integrations page"></DocsImage>

## Status checks

If status checks are enabled within a project's GitHub integration settings, the
Cypress Dashboard will report Cypress test statuses to GitHub for related
commits.
[Status checks](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-status-checks) help
prevent merging a commit or pull-request into the rest of your codebase until
all your Cypress tests have passed.

The Cypress GitHub App reports commit status checks in two separate styles:

- **One check per
  [run group](/guides/guides/parallelization#Grouping-test-runs).**
  <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/status-checks-per-group-failed.png" alt="Status checks per group"></DocsImage>

- **Or one check per spec file.**
  <DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/status-checks-per-spec.png" alt="Status checks per spec"></DocsImage>

Each status check will report the number of test failures or passes, and the
associated **Details** link will direct you to the test run's page within the
Cypress Dashboard to help you dig deeper into the problem via error messages,
stack traces, screenshots, and video recordings:
<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/dashboard-fail-tab.png" alt="Cypress Dashboard failure tab" ></DocsImage>

### Disable status checks

GitHub status checks are optional, and can be disabled within a project's GitHub
integration settings:
<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/status-check-settings.png" alt="Status checks settings" ></DocsImage>

## Pull request comments

The Cypress GitHub App can provide detailed test information within pull
requests via comments that include:

- **Run statistics, such as tests passed, failed, skipped, and over-limit.**
- **Run context details:**
  - The associated Cypress project
  - Final run status (passed, failed, etc)
  - Commit SHA linking to the GitHub commit
  - The time the run started and finished as well as the duration.
  - Operating system version and browser version.
- **Run failures:**
  - The first 10 failures are displayed with a link to more.
  - Each failed test links back to the associated failure within the Cypress
    Dashboard.
  - Screenshot thumbnails are also provided with each failure to conveniently
    provide context.

An example of a Cypress pull-request comment can be seen below:

<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/pr-comment-fail.jpg" alt="Cypress GitHub App PR comment" ></DocsImage>

### Disable PR comments

PR comments and failure screenshot thumbnails are optional, and can be disabled
if not needed within a project's GitHub Integration settings:
<DocsImage src="/img/dashboard/github-integration/pr-comments-settings.png" alt="Status checks settings" ></DocsImage>

## Uninstall the Cypress GitHub app

You can uninstall the Cypress GitHub app from GitHub by performing the following
steps:

1. Go into your organization's **Settings** from within GitHub.
2. Click on **Installed GitHub Apps**.
3. Click **Configure** beside the Cypress app.
4. Click **Uninstall** below the "Uninstall Cypress" section.
