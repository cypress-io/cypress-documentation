<strong class="alert-header">Why authenticate programmatically?</strong>

Typically, logging in a user within your app by authenticating via a third-party
provider requires visiting login pages hosted on a different domain. Since each
Cypress test is limited to visiting domains of the same origin, we can subvert
visiting and testing third-party login pages by programmatically interacting
with the third-party authentication API to login a user.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">

This guide is setup for testing against an [Auth0](https://auth0.com) Single
Page Application using the
[Classic Universal Login Experience](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login/classic).
This configuration is recommended for a "Test Tenant" and/or "Test API" setup
for automated end-to-end testing.

</Alert>

## Auth0 Application Setup

To get started with Auth0, an application needs to be setup within the
[Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard) via the following steps:

1. Visit the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard) and click the
   "Create Application" button.
2. Enter the desired name for your application.
3. Select "Single Page Application"

Once your application is created, visit the
[Application Settings](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/reference/settings-application)
tab under your application, and add your local development URL and port (e.g
`http://localhost:3000`) under the following sections:

- Allowed Callback URLs
- Allowed Logout URLs
- Allowed Web Origins
- Allowed Origins (CORS)

In the bottom of
[Application Settings](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/reference/settings-application),
click
[Show Advanced Settings](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/reference/settings-application#advanced-settings),
select "Grant Types" tab and check "Password" (unchecked by default).

Next, click your Tenant icon (upper right avatar menu) to go to your
[Tenant Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant). On the
[General](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/reference/settings-tenant#general)
tab go to the
[API Authorization Settings](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/reference/settings-tenant#api-authorization-settings)

- Set "Default Audience" to the Audience URL for the Application you are testing
  (e.g. `https://your-api-id.auth0.com/api/v2/`)
- Set "Default Directory" to **"Username-Password-Authentication"**

<Alert>

Refer to the
[Auth0 Tenant Settings documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/reference/settings-tenant)
for additional details.

</Alert>

Finally, create a user in the
[Auth0 User Store](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database#using-the-auth0-user-store)
for testing with Cypress. This testing-dedicated target user will be login to
your application within your test specs. If required for your testing purposes,
you can make as many users needed to test your specific application.

## Setting Auth0 app credentials in Cypress

To have access to test user credentials within our tests we need to configure
Cypress to use the [Auth0](https://auth0.com) environment variables set in the
`.env` file.

:::cypress-env-example

```js
// Populate process.env with values from .env file
require('dotenv').config()
```

```json
{
  "auth0_username": "AUTH0_USERNAME",
  "auth0_password": "AUTH0_PASSWORD",
  "auth0_domain": "REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN",
  "auth0_audience": "REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE",
  "auth0_scope": "REACT_APP_AUTH0_SCOPE",
  "auth0_client_id": "REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENTID",
  "auth0_client_secret": "AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

:::

## Custom Command for Auth0 Authentication

Below is a command to programmatically login into [Auth0](https://auth0.com),
using the
[/oauth/token endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/protocol-oauth2#token-endpoint)
and set an item in localStorage with the authenticated users details, which we
will use in our application code to verify we are authenticated under test.

The `loginByAuth0Api` command will execute the following steps:

1. Use the
   [/oauth/token endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/protocol-oauth2#token-endpoint)
   to perform the programmatic login.
2. Finally the `auth0Cypress` localStorage item is set with the `access token`,
   `id_token` and user profile.

```jsx
// cypress/support/commands.js
Cypress.Commands.add(
  'loginByAuth0Api',
  (username: string, password: string) => {
    cy.log(`Logging in as ${username}`)
    const client_id = Cypress.env('auth0_client_id')
    const client_secret = Cypress.env('auth0_client_secret')
    const audience = Cypress.env('auth0_audience')
    const scope = Cypress.env('auth0_scope')

    cy.request({
      method: 'POST',
      url: `https://${Cypress.env('auth0_domain')}/oauth/token`,
      body: {
        grant_type: 'password',
        username,
        password,
        audience,
        scope,
        client_id,
        client_secret,
      },
    }).then(({ body }) => {
      const claims = jwt.decode(body.id_token)
      const {
        nickname,
        name,
        picture,
        updated_at,
        email,
        email_verified,
        sub,
        exp,
      } = claims

      const item = {
        body: {
          ...body,
          decodedToken: {
            claims,
            user: {
              nickname,
              name,
              picture,
              updated_at,
              email,
              email_verified,
              sub,
            },
            audience,
            client_id,
          },
        },
        expiresAt: exp,
      }

      window.localStorage.setItem('auth0Cypress', JSON.stringify(item))

      cy.visit('/')
    })
  }
)
```

With our Auth0 app setup properly in the Auth0 Developer console, necessary
environment variables in place, and our `loginByAuth0Api` command implemented,
we will be able to authenticate with Auth0 while our app is under test. Below is
a test to login as a user via [Auth0](https://auth0.com), complete the
onboarding process and logout.

```jsx
describe('Auth0', function () {
  beforeEach(function () {
    cy.task('db:seed')
    cy.loginByAuth0Api(
      Cypress.env('auth0_username'),
      Cypress.env('auth0_password')
    )
  })

  it('shows onboarding', function () {
    cy.contains('Get Started').should('be.visible')
  })
})
```

The
[runnable version of this test](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/blob/develop/cypress/tests/ui-auth-providers/auth0.spec.ts)

</Alert>

## Adapting an Auth0 App for Testing

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">Note</strong>

The previous sections focused on the recommended Auth0 authentication practice
within Cypress tests. To use this practice it is assumed you are testing an app
appropriately built or adapted to use Auth0.

The following sections provides guidance on building or adapting an app to use
Auth0 authentication.

</Alert>

The
[Cypress Real World App](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app) is
used and provides configuration and runnable code for both the React SPA and the
Express back end.

The front end uses the [auth0-react SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react)
for React Single Page Applications (SPA), which uses the
[auth0-spa-js SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js) underneath. The back
end uses [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt) to validate JWT's
against [Auth0](https://auth0.com).

<Alert type="info">

<strong class="alert-header">Note</strong>

Use the `yarn dev:auth0` command when starting the
[Cypress Real World App](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app).

</Alert>

### Adapting the back end

In order to validate API requests from the frontend, we install
[express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt) and
[jwks-rsa](https://github.com/auth0/node-jwks-rsa) and configure validation for
JWT's from [Auth0](https://auth0.com).

```jsx
// backend/helpers.ts
import jwt from 'express-jwt'
import jwksRsa from 'jwks-rsa'

dotenv.config()

const auth0JwtConfig = {
  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
    cache: true,
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    jwksUri: `https://${process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/.well-known/jwks.json`,
  }),

  // Validate the audience and the issuer.
  audience: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE,
  issuer: `https://${process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/`,
  algorithms: ['RS256'],
}
```

Next, we'll define an Express middleware function to be use in our routes to
verify the [Auth0](https://auth0.com) JWT sent by the front end API requests as
the `Bearer` token.

```jsx
// backend/helpers.ts

// ...

export const checkJwt = jwt(auth0JwtConfig).unless({ path: ['/testData/*'] })
```

Once this helper is defined, we can use globally to apply to all routes:

```jsx
// backend/app.ts
// initial imports ...
import { checkJwt } from './helpers'

// ...

if (process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0) {
  app.use(checkJwt)
}

// routes ...
```

### Adapting the front end

We need to update our front end React app to allow for authentication with
[Auth0](https://auth0.com). As mentioned above, the
[auth0-react SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react) for React Single Page
Applications (SPA) is used.

First, we create a `AppAuth0.tsx` container to render our application as it is
authenticated with [Auth0](https://auth0.com). The component is identical to the
`App.tsx` component, but uses the `useAuth0` React Hook, removes the need for
the Sign Up and Sign In routes and wraps the component with the
`withAuthenticationRequired` higher order function (HOC).

A `useEffect` hook is added to get the access token for the authenticated user
and send an `AUTH0` event with the `user` and `token` objects to work with the
existing authentication layer (`authMachine.ts`).

```jsx
// src/containers/AppAuth0.tsx

// initial imports ...

import { withAuthenticationRequired, useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react'

// ...

const AppAuth0 = () => {
  const { isAuthenticated, user, getAccessTokenSilently } = useAuth0()

  // ...

  useEffect(() => {
    ;(async function waitForToken() {
      const token = await getAccessTokenSilently()
      authService.send('AUTH0', { user, token })
    })()
  }, [user, getAccessTokenSilently])

  // ...

  const isLoggedIn =
    isAuthenticated &&
    (authState.matches('authorized') ||
      authState.matches('refreshing') ||
      authState.matches('updating'))

  return <div className={classes.root}>// ...</div>
}

export default withAuthenticationRequired(AppAuth0)
```

Note: The full
[AppAuth0.tsx component](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/blob/develop/src/containers/AppAuth0.tsx)
is in the
[Cypress Real World App](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app).

Next, we update our entry point (`index.tsx`) to wrap our application with the
`<Auth0Provider>` from the
[auth0-react SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react) SDK providing a custom
`onRedirectCallback`. We pass props for the Auth0 environment variables set in
`.env` above, and render our `<AppAuth0>` component as the application.

```jsx
// src/index.tsx

// initial imports ...

import AppAuth0 from "./containers/AppAuth0";

// ..

const onRedirectCallback = (appState: any) => {
  history.replace((appState && appState.returnTo) || window.location.pathname);
};

if (process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0) {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Auth0Provider
      domain={process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN!}
      clientId={process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENTID!}
      redirectUri={window.location.origin}
      audience={process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE}
      scope={process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_SCOPE}
      onRedirectCallback={onRedirectCallback}
    >
      <Router history={history}>
        <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
          <AppAuth0 />
        </ThemeProvider>
      </Router>
    </Auth0Provider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
  );
} else {
  // render passport-local App.tsx
}
```

An update to our
[AppAuth0.tsx component](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/blob/develop/src/containers/AppAuth0.tsx)
is needed to conditionally use the `auth0Cypress` localStorage item.

In the code below, we conditionally apply a `useEffect` block based on being
under test with Cypress (using `window.Cypress`).

In addition, we will update the export to be wrapped with
`withAuthenticationRequired` if we are not under test in Cypress. This allows
our application to work with the [Auth0](https://auth0.com) redirect login flow
in development/production but not when under test in Cypress.

```jsx
// src/containers/AppAuth0.tsx

// initial imports ...

import { withAuthenticationRequired, useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

// ...

const AppAuth0 = () => {
  const { isAuthenticated, user, getAccessTokenSilently } = useAuth0();

  // ...

  useEffect(() => {
      (async function waitForToken() {
        const token = await getAccessTokenSilently();
        authService.send("AUTH0", { user, token });
      })();
    }, [user, getAccessTokenSilently]);

  // If under test in Cypress, get credentials from "auth0Cypress" localstorage item and send event to our state management to log the user into the SPA
  if (window.Cypress) {
    useEffect(() => {
      const auth0 = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("auth0Cypress")!);
      authService.send("AUTH0", {
        user: auth0.body.decodedToken.user,
        token: auth0.body.access_token,
      });
    }, []);
  } else {
    useEffect(() => {
      (async function waitForToken() {
        const token = await getAccessTokenSilently();
        authService.send("AUTH0", { user, token });
      })();
    }, [isAuthenticated, user, getAccessTokenSilently]);
  }

  // ...

  const isLoggedIn =
    isAuthenticated &&
    (authState.matches("authorized") ||
      authState.matches("refreshing") ||
      authState.matches("updating"));

  return (
    <div className={classes.root}>
      // ...
    </div>
  );
};

// Conditional export wrapped with `withAuthenticationRequired` if we are not under test in Cypress.
let appAuth0 = window.Cypress ? AppAuth0 : withAuthenticationRequired(AppAuth0);
export default appAuth0
```

## Auth0 Rate Limiting Logins

Be aware of the rate limit statement in the Auth0 documentation:

[Auth0 Rate Limit](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/rate-limits) -
"If a user attempts to login 20 times per minute as the same user from the same
location, regardless of having the correct credentials, the rate limit will come
into effect. When this happens, the user can make 10 attempts per minute."

This limit can be reached as the size of a test suite grows along with enabling
[parallelized runs](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization) to speed up test run
duration.

If you run into this rate limit, a programmatic approach can be added to the
`loginByAuth0` command to clear a blocked IP prior to the test run.

Next you'll need to obtain a
[API token](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/tokens) to interact with
the [Auth0 Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2). This token
is a JSON Web Token (JWT) and it contains specific granted permissions for the
API.

Add this token as environment variable `AUTH0_MGMT_API_TOKEN` to our
[Cypress Real World App](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app)
`.env` with your API token.

```jsx
// .env
// ... additional keys
AUTH0_MGMT_API_TOKEN = 'YOUR-MANAGEMENT-API-TOKEN'
```

With this token in place, we can add interaction with the
[Auth0 Anomaly remove the blocked IP address endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Anomaly/delete_ips_by_id)
to our `loginByAuth0Api` command. This will send a delete request to
[Auth0 Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) anomaly
endpoint to unblock an IP that may become blocked during the test run.
