## 0.12.1

_Released 10/28/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- `cy.route()` will no longer throw that a response is needed when using
  `cy.server({stub: false})`.
- Applying server defaults to `Cypress.Server.defaults({})` now works as
  documented.
- `onRequest` and `onResponse` can now be correctly set as permanent server
  defaults.
- XHR URL is now decoded to make assertions easier. Fixes
