  Addressed in [#21250](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21250) and
  [#22497](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22497).
- Added a new clear button to easily clear the search text when filtering specs
  in the Cypress runner. Fixes
  [#21686](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21686).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a memory leak in Chromium-based browsers caused by storing `data:` urls
  containing base64 encoded files unnecessarily. Fixed
  [#17853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17853) and
  [#22462](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22462).
- Updated cross-origin cookie handling to align with browser behavior. This
  fixed various issues with cookies when testing across multiple origins. Fixed
  [#21363](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21363) and
  [#20685](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20685).
- Updated Cypress to use posix paths to fix an issue on Windows when a project
  required `node-ts`. Fixes
  [#22544](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22544) and
  [#22297](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22297).
- Fixed a 9.x to 10.x migration bug where the migration tool would hang without
  a response when it attempted to read the `pluginsFile` contents when the
  `pluginsFile` value was a directory path instead of a relative file path.
  Fixed [#22461](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22461).
- Fixed the process profiler to output Cypress's summarized CPU and memory
  metrics when the `cypress:server:util:process_profiler` debug stream is
  enabled. Fixed [#22022](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22022).
- Fix styling issue observed when long text was entered in the search when
  filtering specs in the Cypress runner. Fixes
  [#21686](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21686).
- Corrected the Typescript types to include `baseUrl` as a valid test config
  override option. Fixes
  [#22374](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22374) and
  [#22072](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22072).
