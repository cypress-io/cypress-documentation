## 2.0.3

*Released 2/21/2018*

**Bugfixes:**

- The runner no longer appears to "hang" if a `before` hook fails in a test with siblings. Previously the test would never generate a `status` and look pending forever. This was a visual bug only. Fixes [#1343](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1343).
- The Desktop GUI properly renders folders that contain specs in Windows now. Fixes [#1335](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1335).

**Misc:**

- The viewport dropdown helper in the Runner now displays string quoted JSON instead of an object literal. This better matches how you should write those options in `cypress.json`. Fixes [#1350](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1350).
