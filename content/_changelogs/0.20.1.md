## 0.20.1

_Released 09/17/2017_

**Features:**

- `cypress run` now supports a `--headed` option so the Electron browser will display instead of running headlessly. This matches what you can already do in the GUI. Fixes [#657](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/657).

**Bugfixes:**

- Using Cypress on nested projects now correctly works. Fixes [#635](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/635).
- Using `cy.type` on Angular 2 apps now works. We're now firing the `key` property when typing. We've properly mapped all the special keys too.
- `onBeforeLoad` now gets invoked when overriding `cy.visit`. Fixes [#656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/656) and [#640](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/640).
- Using multiple `cy.visit` back to back which only change the `hash` now properly wait for the `hashchange` event to occur before moving on. Fixes [#652](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/652).
- CLI now displays the correct overridden `CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION` on first open. Fixes [#659](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/659).
- Fixed the incorrectly spelled chainer `descendents`. It is now correctly spelled as `descendants`. Fixes [#642](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/642).
- The visibility algorithm has been considerably improved. Should fix most if not all visibility problems. We accounted for CSS transforms, translations, and added a new branch of logic for `position: fixed` elements which should be much more accurate. Fixes [#631](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/631).
- The CLI now treats `-h` and `--help` and `help` as valid commands. Fixes [#645](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/645).

**Misc:**

- You can now pass an object literal as `config` when using Cypress as a node module. Fixes [#639](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/639).
- Passing `--reporter` can now reference an absolute path instead of just relative. Fixes [#658](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/658).
- The algorithm that ensures an element is not covered now calculates this at the center coordinates instead of the top left. This should yield more accurate results, be closer to the default expectations of users, and bypass fractional pixel problems we were having. Fixes [#655](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/655).
- Improved crash reporting when the binary throws an uncaught error.
