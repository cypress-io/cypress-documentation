## 12.2.0

_Released 12/20/2022_

**Features:**

- Added the ability to match on `resourceType` with
  [`cy.intercept()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept), and to see
  the resource type of an intercepted request as `req.resourceType`. Addresses
  [#14525](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14525).
- Users working in React Component Testing projects can now generate a basic
  spec file from the components that exist in their project. Addresses
  [#24008](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24008).

**Performance:**

- Fixed a regression introduced in the Electron browser in
  [Cypress 10.8.0](#10-8-0) where the `CYPRESS_EVERY_NTH_FRAME` environment
  variable was not being set appropriately causing all frames to be captured
  which slowed down tests. Fixes
  [#23830](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23830).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where the `query` object was not available on requests from
  [`cy.intercept()`](/api/commands/intercept) once they were yielded. Fixes
  [#25088](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25088).
- Fixed an issue with Angular Component Testing where urls within SASS/SCSS
  files were not being correctly resolved which could result in incomplete
  styling. Fixes [#24272](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24272).
- Fixed a regression introduced in [Cypress 12](#12-0-0) where
  [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get) would ignore a `null` value for the
  `withinSubject` option. Fixes
  [#25104](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25104).
- Fixed an issue where an unhandled promise rejection would display an
  incomplete error message in the command log. Fixes
  [#24915](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24915).
- Fixed an issue where the incorrect Cypress version could be shown in the
  migration wizard. Fixes
  [#25138](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25138).
- Fixed an issue where the Cypress migration wizard would fail to run in
  [global mode](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open-global) on newer
  versions of Cypress. Addressed in
  [#25138](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25138).
- Fixed an issue with Angular Component Testing where a custom
  [`sourceRoot`](https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config#project-configuration-options)
  configuration would not be respected. Fixes
  [#24827](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24827).
- Fixed Typescript typings for [`cy.nextUntil()`](/api/commands/nextuntil) to
  include the `filter` parameter. Fixes
  [#24772](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24772).
