## 0.15.2

_Released 04/03/2016_

**Features:**

- The [error message when Cypress detects that a test has ended early](/guides/references/error-messages) (there are still commands left in the queue) now displays a list of these commands with a much improved explanation.
- There is now a new [configuration option](/guides/references/configuration): `watchForFileChanges` that, when set to `false` in the `cypress.json`, will prevent Cypress from attempting to watch for file changes and restart your tests.
- You can now set the default [`reporter`](/guides/references/configuration) in `cypress.json` for use during `cypress run` or in CI.

**Bugfixes:**

- The [--reporter](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) CLI option is now working again.
- the `teamcity` reporter is now also working again.

**Misc:**

- Updated favicon + logo mark
