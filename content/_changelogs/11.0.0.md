## 11.0.0

_Released 11/08/2022_

**Summary:**

Component Testing is now generally available for projects using React, Next.js,
Angular, and Vue!

Component tests allow you to see and test your application's components in a
real browser as you work. You can use your favorite Cypress commands and
features to develop your components without running your whole app. Learn more
in our [blog](https://on.cypress.io/cypress-11-release) post.

We have also massively improved our startup performance by shipping a snapshot
of our binary instead of the source files. The performance boost applies to the
time it takes from running a cypress command (e.g. `cypress open`) to when the
Cypress app is opened. Results will vary based on your situation, but we saw up
to 84% faster startup times!

**Breaking Changes:**

**Read our
[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide#Migrating-to-Cypress-version-11-0)
which explains the breaking changes in more detail.**

###### Component Testing:

- Removed `cssFile`, `cssFiles`, `style`, `styles`, `stylesheet`, and
  `stylesheets` from the `options` argument to the `cy.mount()` function. We
  recommend writing test-specific styles in a separate `css` file you import in
  your test, or in your `supportFile`. See
  [migration guide](/guides/references/migration-guide#Changes-to-Mounting-Options).
  Addresses [#24328](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24328).
- Subsequent `cy.mount` calls within the same test will remove the last mounted
  component from the DOM. Addresses
  [#24329](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24329).
- `mountHook` from `cypress/react` has been removed. We recommend replacing it
  with `mount` and a component. See
  [migration guide](/guides/references/migration-guide#React-mountHook-Removed).
  Addresses [#24328](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24328).
- `unmount` from `cypress/react` has been removed. We recommend using the API
  React provides for unmounting components,
  [unmountComponentAtNode](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#unmountcomponentatnode).
  See
  [migration guide](/guides/references/migration-guide#React-unmount-Removed).
  Addresses [#24328](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24328).
- `mountCallback` from `cypress/vue` has been removed. We recommend using
  `mount`. See
  [migration guide](/guides/references/migration-guide#Vue-mountCallback-Removed).
  Addresses [#24328](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24328).
- `mount` from `cypress/vue` now returns an object with both the VueWrapper
  (wrapper) and the component instance (component). Addresses
  [#24342](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24342).
- When providing an inline `viteConfig` inside of `cypress.config`, any
  `vite.config.js` file is not automatically merged. See
  [migration guide](/guides/references/migration-guide#Vite-Dev-Server-cypress-vite-dev-server).
  Addresses [#24133](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24133).
- Angular providers passed as part of the mounting options will be assigned at
  the module level using the `TestBed.configureTestingModule` API. This means
  that module-level providers (resolved from imports or
  `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` can be overridden, but providers
  specified in `@Component({ providers: [...] })` will not be overridden when
  using `cy.mount(MyComponent, { providers: [...] })`. To override
  component-level providers, use the `TestBed.overrideComponent` API. See
  [migration guide](/guides/references/migration-guide#Angular-Providers-Mounting-Options-Change).
  Addresses [#24047](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24047) and
  [#23427](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23427).

###### General:

- Communication with the Cypress Dashboard will now verify CAs and reject any
  unauthorized calls. If you use a self-signed CA you will need to set
  `npm_config_ca`, `npm_config_cafile`, or `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Addresses
  [#23980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23980).

###### Experimental:

- [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) now requires a setup command to use
  the command. Addresses
  [#24311](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24311).

**Features:**

- Incorporated V8 snapshots into the build process of the Electron binary to
  improve startup time and reduce the time to download and unzip the binary
  during installation. Startup time is the time from running a command to when
  Cypress's window is first opened. Addresses
  [#18480](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18480).
- `cy.getCookie()`, `cy.getCookies()`, `cy.setCookie()`, `cy.clearCookie()`, and
  `cy.clearCookies()` now accept a domain option. Addresses
  [#24264](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24264).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fix types associated with `cy.mount()` that were incorrectly typed as `any`.
  Fixes [#24330](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24330).
- The `cy.mount()` snapshot now shows the mounted component instead of a blank
  page. Fixes [#24138](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24138).
- "Open in IDE" is no longer displayed in the command log for component tests.
  Fixes [#24366](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24366).
- Cypress now correctly handles CSVs and other non-html MIME types. Fixes
  [#24297](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24297).
- Cypress now supports project directories mounted on read-only file systems.
  Fixes [#2064](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2064).
- Snapshots now capture the AUT correctly when it has navigated away. Fixes
  [#24506](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24506).
- `cy.pause()` now functions correctly when called within the `cy.origin()`
  callback. Fixes [#21495](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21495).
- When utilizing dependencies within the `cy.origin()` callback, errors now show
  the correct code frame. Fixes
  [#23365](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23365).
- The select dropdown (in Front-end Framework, Bundler, Organization, Project,
  Preferred Editor) now highlights and adds a checkmark to the selected option.
  Fixes [#21768](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21768).
- The failure icon in the reporter header now displays correctly when there are
  a large number of successful tests. Fixes
  [#21838](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21838).
- Cypress now allows more than twenty sessions to be created in a single test.
  Fixed in [#24379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24379).
