## 11.0.0

_Released 11/08/2022_

**Summary:**

Component Testing is now generally available for projects using React, Next.js,
Angular, and Vue!

Component tests allow you to see and test your applicationâ€™s components in a
real browser as you work. You can use your favorite Cypress commands and
features to develop your components without running your whole app. Learn more
in our [blog](https://on.cypress.io/cypress-11-release) post.

We have also massively improved our startup performance by shipping a snapshot
of our binary instead of the source files. Results will vary based on your
situation, but we saw up to 84% faster startup times!

**Breaking Changes:**

**Read our [Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains
the breaking changes in more detail.**

**Experimental Breaking Changes:**

- [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) now requires a setup command to use
  the command. Addresses
  [#24311](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24311).

**Features:**

- Incorporated V8 snapshots into the build process of the Electron binary to
  improve startup time and reduce the time to download and unzip the binary
  during installation. Addresses
  [#18480](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18480).
- cy.getCookie(), cy.getCookies(), cy.setCookie(), cy.clearCookie(), and
  cy.clearCookies() now accept a domain option. Addresses
  [#24264](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24264)
- Communication with the Cypress Cloud will now verify CAs and reject any
  unauthorized calls. If you use a self-signed CA you will need to set
  `npm_config_ca`, `npm_config_cafile`, or `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Addresses
  [#23980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23980)

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress now allows more than 20 sessions to be created in a single test. Fixes
  [#24379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24379).
- Support project directories mounted on read-only filesystems. Fixes
  [#2064](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2064).
- `cy.pause()` now functions correctly when called within the `cy.origin()`
  callback. Fixes [#21495](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21495).
- `vite.config.{js,ts}` will no longer be sourced when
  `component.devServer.viteConfig` is provided in the project's Cypress config.
  Fixes [#24133](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24133).
- Fixed a bug where icon within stats of reporter header don't account for 4
  digit test count. Fixes
  [#21838](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21838).
- When utilizing dependencies within the `cy.origin()` callback, errors now show
  the correct code frame. Fixes
  [#23365](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23365).
- Fix types associated with `cy.mount` that we incorrectly `any` typed. Fixes
  [#24330](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24330).
- Introduced `componentProviders` for Angular component testing which overrides
  a component's providers. Changes the existing providers so that they work
  exactly as the ones from `TestModuleMetadata::providers`. Fixes
  [#24047](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24047) and
  [#23427](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23427).
- Fixes an issue where Cypress would accidentally inject into csvs and other
  non-html mimetypes. Fixes
  [#24297](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24297).
- Previously when hovering over mount in the reporter of a component test, the
  AUT shows a blank white view instead of the mounted component. This is not
  ideal if the user wants to see the component that has been mounted by the
  mount function. This PR ensures that the snapshot of the mounted component is
  taken at the current time thereby guaranteeing component being displayed in
  the AUT. Fixes [#24138](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24138)
- Fix issue for the Select Component do not show the current value as selected
  in the dropdown with the visible checkmark and other styling. Fixes
  [#21768](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/).
- Subsequent mount calls within the same test will remove the last mounted
  component from the DOM. Fixes
  [#24329](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24329).
- User will no longer see "Open in IDE" in the command log for component tests.
  Fixes [#24366](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24366).
