## 2.0.2

_Released 2/17/2018_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed more edge cases where legitimate JavaScript code was being modified
  unexpectedly by the
  [modifyObstructiveCode](/guides/references/configuration#Browser)
  configuration. We've tightened up the RegExp even more and added 40 popular JS
  libraries to test against to ensure they are not modified. Fixes
  [#1334](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1334).
- Fixed an edge case when hooks such as `beforeEach` or `afterEach` threw an
  **identical** error message, Cypress would hang indefinitely and never finish
  running the tests. Fixes
  [#674](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/674).
- Fixed bug when `Errors` that threw with no arguments: `throw new Error()` and
  had their messages appended would duplicate the message over and over again.
  Fixes [#1338](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1338).
