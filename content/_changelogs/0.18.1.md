## 0.18.1

_Released 12/11/2016_

**Notes:**

- There is a new
  [recipe showcasing these new features](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes).
- We are adding several other recipes to show examples of all the ways you can
  use [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) to improve your tests.

**Features:**

- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) can now have its automatic redirect
  following turned off by passing `{followRedirect: false}`. Fixes
  [#308](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/308).
- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) now has a `qs` option that
  automatically appends query params to the `url` property. Fixes
  [#321](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/321).
- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) now follows redirects exactly like a
  real browser. Previously if you `POST`ed to an endpoint and it redirected to a
  `GET` then [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) would not follow it due to
  the `method` changing. It now follows method changing redirects by default.
  Fixes [#322](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/322).
- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) now accepts the `form` option which
  will convert the `body` values to urlencoded content and automatically set the
  `x-www-form-urlencoded` header. This means you can now use
  [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) to bypass your UI and login with
  standard form values. Fixes
  [#319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/319).
- When [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) fails, it now outputs the full
  request / response information. This behaves more similar to
  [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) failures. Fixes
  [#324](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/324).
- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) now prints **all** of the underlying
  HTTP request / response information into the Dev Tools' console (when clicking
  on the Command Log). This means that you will see everything you would
  normally see from the `Network` tab as if the request were made from the
  browser. We even print redirect information. Fixes
  [#325](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/325).

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress' internal `babel` will no longer attempt to load your project's
  `.babelrc`. This helps avoid potential version conflicts. Fixes
  [#312](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/312).
- We no longer watch the `supportFile` while running `cypress run`. Fixes
  [#329](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/329).
- `watchForFileChanges` is now correctly respected in regards to watching all
  files, including the `supportFile`. Fixes
  [#336](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/336).
- There is no longer an error when scaffolding a new Cypress project. Fixes
  [#326](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/326).
- The Runner UI no longer appears to be "running" when there is a spec bundle
  error in the `supportFile`.
- Cypress now correctly exits during `cypress run` in `linux` when the browser
  fails to connect. Fixes
  [#333](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/333).
- Cypress now correctly exits during `cypress run` in `linux` when there is a
  spec bundle error. Fixes
  [#337](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/337).
- Cypress now retries up to 3 times for the browser to connect during
  `cypress run`. The warning / error messages were also updated to be clearer.
  Partially addresses [#334](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/334).

**Misc:**

- Deprecated `failOnStatus` property for [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request)
  and renamed to `failOnStatusCode`. Fixes
  [#323](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/323).
- Removed the `cookies` option from [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request)
  because cookies are now _always_ get/set on requests. This option really never
  made any sense to have. Fixes
  [#320](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/320).
- Better data reporting when recording builds in CI.
- We now collect "global" errors that may prevent any tests from running. We
  will be displaying these in our future CI platform.
