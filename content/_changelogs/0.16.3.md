## 0.16.3

_Released 06/17/2016_

**Features:**

- [`cy.route()`](/api/commands/route) now accepts string glob patterns using
  [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) under the hood. This means
  you can more easily route dynamic urls without using `regex`. Example:
  `cy.route('POST', '/users/*/comments', {})`.
- [`Cypress.minimatch`](/api/utilities/minimatch) is now exposed so you can
  easily test globbing patterns.
- [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) can now be used on non-input elements that
  have a `tabindex` attribute. Key events will fire but no text content will
  change and no input based events fire. Fixes
  [#172](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/172).
- There is now an [`ignoreTestFiles`](/guides/references/configuration)
  configuration option that accepts an array of `glob` patterns. This enables
  you to ignore extraneous spec files that may be created during a build
  process. The default pattern is `*.hot-update.js` which will ignore
  dynamically generated webpack hot module swapping files. Fixes
  [#159](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/159).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a bug where Cypress could get into a weird state and continuously error
  due to the `before:log` event not being properly disposed. Fixes
  [#173](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/173).
- Fixed a bug where invalid UTF-8 characters were being set in XHR headers which
  caused XHR's to fail. We now properly encode and decode all values. Fixes
  [#168](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/168).
- Nested directories under `cypress/support` no longer cause a `500` when tests
  run. This was due to Cypress not ignoring directories and trying to serve them
  as regular files. Fixes
  [#163](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/163).
- Fixed situations where 3rd party libraries (such as
  [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) were instrumenting XHR's identical to
  Cypress' implementation. This caused an infinite loop which would crash the
  browser. We've updated how we instrument XHR's to take this into account and
  deployed multiple fallbacks and strategies to prevent this kind of thing from
  happening in the future. Fixes
  [#166](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/166).

**Misc:**

- [`Cypress.Server.defaults()`](/api/cypress-api/cypress-server) now accepts a
  `urlMatchingOptions` option for passing options to
  [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch).
- [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) now exits with the
  number of test failures instead of always exiting with 0. This matches the
  same way `cypress ci` works. Fixes
  [#167](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/167).
- In the [Cypress CLI tool](/guides/guides/command-line) package version
  `0.11.1`, you can now pass the `--spec` option to `cypress ci`. This enables
  you to run a specific spec file as opposed to all tests. Fixes
  [#161](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/161).
