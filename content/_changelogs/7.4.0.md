## 7.4.0

_Released 05/24/2021_

**Features:**

- Cypress now detects and supports testing in the Chrome Beta browser. Addresses
  [#16376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16376).
- There are new keyboard shortcuts to continue (c) and to go to the next test
  (n) when the Test Runner is paused via `.pause()` and to toggle auto-scrolling
  of the Test Runner (a). Addresses
  [#248](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/248).

**Bugfixes:**

  data. Fixes [#1647](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1647).
- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) can now send blob data. Fixes
  [#6178](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6178).
- Fixed an issue where [`cy.wait()`](/api/commands/wait) could yield the
  incorrect result when used with [`cy.intercept()`](/api/commands/intercept)
  and several simultaneous requests. Fixes
  [#16451](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16451).

  displayed in the Command Log when using `RouteMatcher` properties besides
  `url` and `method`. Fixes
  [#9403](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9403).
- [`cy.intercept()`](/api/commands/intercept) argument validation has been
  improved. Invalid hostnames and extra arguments passed to `cy.intercept()` now
  result in an error. Addressed in
  [#16577](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16577).

  parts of the Test Runner UI during component testing. Fixes

  `cypress open-ct`. Fixes
  [#16278](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16278).

  returned from plugins in the component testing runner. Fixes

- Video recordings in Chrome, Chromium, and Electron browsers will no longer
  drop frames, with the frequency increasing along with the length of the video.
  Fixes [#16648](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16648).
- Tests located outside of the `projectRoot` will now open in IDE and generate
  studio commands when saved. Fixes
