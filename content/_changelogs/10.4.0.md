## 10.4.0

_Released 8/2/2022_

**Features:**

- Cypress Component testing now supports React 18 via the cypress/react18
  package. Addresses
  [#21381](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21381) &

- Cypress Component testing now supports Vite 3. Addresses
  [#22784](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22784).
- Cypress introduces a new experimental flag, called
  `experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode`. When enabled,
  `experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode` will turn on additional
  `modifyObstructiveCode` options to prevent frame busting, as well as striping
  integrity tags out of `<link>` and `<script>` elements and remove the electron
  user agent. In the current state of this experimental flag, SRI is not
  supported. Addresses

  uses a projectId that cannot be found in the Cypress Dashboard and when you do
  not have access to the current project in the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses
