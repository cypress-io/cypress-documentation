## 3.8.1

_Released 12/26/2019_

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a bug where [cypress run --headless](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-headless) would not run Chrome-family browsers headlessly. Fixes [#5949](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5949).
- We fixed an issue where, on some systems with IPv4 and IPv6 enabled, Cypress would fail to connect to the Chrome DevTools Protocol while launching Chrome, leading to test failures. Fixes [#5912](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5912).
- The strict cookie validation added in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) for [cy.setCookie()](/api/commands/setcookie), [cy.clearCookie()](/api/commands/clearcookie), and [cy.getCookie()](/api/commands/getcookie) has been removed. Fixes [#5642](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5642).
- We fixed a regression in [3.8.0](#3-8-0) where using [.type()](/api/commands/type) on number inputs to type non-number characters or the `{enter}` special character would not type the correct value. Fixes [#5968](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5968) and [#5997](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5997).
- Configuration values set from the plugin file now display with the correct background color in the Configuration panel in the Test Runner Settings. Fixes [#6024](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6024).
- We removed the 'Me' and 'An Organization' selections in the Test Runner when setting up a project to more closely match the Dashboard UI. This also fixes an edge case where a user with no default organizations could potentially be unable to set up a project. Fixes [#5954](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5954).

**Misc:**

- We updated the fallback error message for visibility checks to be less confusing. Addresses [#5982](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5982).
- The type definitions for [cy.location()](/api/commands/location) have been improved. Addresses [#5574](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5574).
