## 10.8.0

_Released 9/13/2022_

**Features:**

- You can now run tests in Webkit, Safari's browser engine, by enabling the
  [`experimentalWebKitSupport`](/guides/references/experiments) experiment and
  installing
  [`playwright-webkit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-webkit). For
  more details, read
  [our blog post](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2022/09/13/cypress-10-8-experimental-run-tests-in-webkit).
  Addresses [#6422](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6422).

**Performance:**

- Several minor changes were made to reduce Cypress's memory footprint in the
  browser in an attempt to improve test times and reduce the likelihood of
  crashing the launched browser under test. Addressed in
  [#23708](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23708),
  [#23729](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23729),
  [#23737](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23737), and
  [#23738](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23738).

**Bugfixes:**

- The Dashboard will now correctly show whether a video of the spec was uploaded
  to review. Before this change, the Dashboard would shows the error message
  `The media could not be loaded` when a passing test's video was not uploaded
  because `videoUploadOnPasses` was `false`. Fixes
  [#2939](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2939).
- Fixed an issue where the stack traces in `run` mode did not match the stack
  traces shown in `open` mode. Now, in the terminal, users will see the source
  map line and column number in the error stack trace. Fixes
  [#7715](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7715).
- Fixed a bug where projects using Node.js 16.17+ and 18.6+ with ES Modules and
  TypeScript were not working with Cypress. Fixes
  [#22795](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22795),
  [#23393](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23393), and
  [#23552](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23552).
- When searching for specs we now normalize OS-specific path separators so that
  Windows users can use back- and forward-slashes. Fixes
  [#23426](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23426).
- Fixed an regression introduced in Cypress [10.3.0](#10-3-0), and further
  exposed in [10.4.0](#10-4-0), that omitted `same-site` cookies when the URL
  Scheme, Domain, and Top Level Domain matched, but the ports are different
  (i.e. same-site). Fixes
  [#23132](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23132).
- Autoscrolling of the command log can no longer become disabled in `run` mode.
  This fixes an issue observed where the reporter randomly stops scrolling
  during a video recording and the Command log details are not visible. Fixes
  [#16098](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16098) and
  [#22199](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22199).
- The `cypress/react18` [`cy.mount()`](/guides/component-testing/mounting-react)
  command's yielded rerender function has been updated to only create one
  `ReactDom.Root` element. This fixes the issue where state did not persist
  between rerenders, and all lifecycle hooks were reran when executed. Fixes
  [#23357](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23357).
- Fixed a regression introduced in Cypress [10.0.0](#10-0-0) where Cypress was
  incompatible with Chrome v64 - v70. Fixes
  [#23509](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23509).
- Fixes an issue where outdated organization and project information could be
  shown in dialogs when connecting a project to the Cypress Dashboard. Fixes
  [#23538](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23538).
- The `Sec-Fetch-Dest`
  [metadata request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Fetch_metadata_request_header)
  is now set to `document` when the request is sent from the Application Under
  Test when the
  [`experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode`](/guides/references/experiments#Configuration)
  experiment is enabled. This was updated to prevent Google Authentication from
  returning `403 forbidden` in Edge and Electron. Fixes
  [#23720](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23720).
- Correctly override the Electron `userAgent`when the
  [`userAgent`](/guides/references/configuration#Browser) configuration option
  is provided or
  [`experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode`](/guides/references/experiments#Configuration)
  experiment is enabled. Fixes
  [#23597](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23597).
- Fix regression introduced by Cypress [10.0.0](#10.0.0) where the `before:spec`
  plugin event was not triggered in `open` mode when the
  [`experimentalInteractiveRunEvents`](/guides/references/experiments#Configuration)
  experiment was enabled. Fixed #22360.
- Fixed a regression introduced in [10.4.0](#10.4.0) where referencing an
  aliased custom command would return undefined. Fixes
  [#23652](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23652).
- Users can now log into the Dashboard from the "Choose a browser" page of the
  Launchpad even if a browser is not open. Fixes
  [#23779](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23779).
- Fixed a bug where the `cypress/svelte`
  [`cy.mount()`](/guides/component-testing/mounting-svelte) command was not
  logging by default. Fixed in
  [#23771](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23771).
- Fixed an issue where setting the
  [`testIsolation`](/guides/references/configuration#Global) configuration at
  the suite-level would throw on the second test. Fixes
  [#23644](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23644).
- Removed misleading dependency warning in Launchpad for Next.js applications
  using component testing. Fixes
  [#23598](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23598).
- Added [`modifyObstructiveCode`](/guides/references/configuration#Browser)
  TypeScript types. Fixes
  [#22146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22146).
- Assertions will no longer 'vibrate' in the command log when asserting on the
  text of elements with trailing whitespace. Fixed in
  [#23727](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23727).

**Misc:**

- There were some minor improvements made to the UI when configuration files are
  created for a project when using the Project Setup workflow. Addressed in
  [#21847](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21847),
  [#23260](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23260) and
  [#23710](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23710).
