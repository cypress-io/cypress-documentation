## 0.4.1

_Released 04/08/2015_

**Features:**

- `javascripts` files can now utilize `snockets`, `browserify`, or `requirejs`.

**Bugfixes:**

- Handle `javascripts` and preprocess them as we do regular specs. Fixes:
  [#15](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15).
- Fixed an edge case when writing a test with a `done` callback alongside `cy`
  commands. This situation would always cause a timeout after 30 seconds even
  though the test would pass.

**Misc:**

- Internally refactored Cypress for easier testability / debuggability.
- Organized files around in preparation for OS release.
- Added lightweight module system / optimized Cypress listeners to prevent
  duplicated events.
- Changed url strategy for sending down `spec` files.
