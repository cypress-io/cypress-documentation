## 3.4.0

_Released 7/9/2019_

**Features:**

- Users can now log in to the Test Runner through the browser installed on their
  system. This also allows for login via GitHub with U2F keys. Addresses
  [#3583](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3583),
  [#4337](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4337), and
  [#1162](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1162).

  Addresses [#3519](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3519).

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress now properly supports partial matching of string values for assertions
  `contain.text`, `contain.html`, and `contain.value`. Fixes
  [#1969](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1969).
- A form is now properly submitted when using `.type('{enter}')` on a form
  containing no buttons and only one input that allows implicit submission.
  Fixes [#4495](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4495).
- Extra whitespace and quotations are now stripped from the
  `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` environment variable to help prevent some unexpected
  results when set in Windows. Fixes
  [#4506](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4506).
- Electron rendering warnings are no longer printed to console output. Fixes
  [#4288](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4288).

**Misc:**

- We now expose a downloadable binary for each commit made into the
  [develop branch](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/commits/develop) of the
  [cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) repository so that
  pre-released versions can be installed. See
  [this commit](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/commit/52ca8ed8399c5ef467efbee7a2d00fe0863e7f36#commitcomment-34237047)
  for an example. Addresses
  [#4525](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4525).
- There are now a series of checks that are run during download of Cypress to
  verify that the zip file downloaded is the correct file. Addresses
  [#812](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/812) and
  [#3515](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3515).
- A warning now displays for Windows' users who have Group Policy settings that
  may interfere with usage of Cypress. Addresses
  [#4391](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4391).
- There's a new warning when mouse interactions fail displaying that it failed
  due to the element having CSS `pointer-events: none`. Addresses
  [#3164](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3164).
- If a URL is passed to [cy.route()](/api/commands/route) containing
  percent-encoded characters, we now display a warning explaining that
  `cy.route()` expects a decoded URL. Addresses
  [#2372](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2372).
- Environment variables for Semaphore 2.0 are now captured when recording tests
  to the Dashboard. Fixes
  [#4671](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4671).
- We now capture environment variables set from Concourse CI when recording
  tests to the Dashboard. Fixes
  [#4376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4376).
- We replaced capturing environment variables from SnapCI (which is no longer
  available) to instead capture ones set from GoCD when recording tests to the
  Dashboard. Fixes [#2680](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2680).
- The [JSON schema file](https://on.cypress.io/cypress.schema.json) used for
  [intelligent code completion](/guides/tooling/IDE-integration#Intelligent-Code-Completion)
  for the Cypress configuration file has been updated to match our
  documentation.
