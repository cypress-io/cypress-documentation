## 0.7.6

_Released 06/23/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent infinite loop due to a trifecta of rare circumstances with
  [`.click()`](/api/commands/click). Clicking will now retry sync after it
  attempts to scroll past the element covering up the desired clickable element.
  Fixes [#46](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/46).
