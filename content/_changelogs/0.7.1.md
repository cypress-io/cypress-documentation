## 0.7.1

_Released 06/16/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- DOM commands which can retry now correctly support `{timeout: num}` options
  which will raise the timeout beyond the standard `commandTimeout` rom
  `cypress.json`.
- `<script>`, `<img>`, `<video>` commands or any other element which supports
  `crossorigin` attribute now are proxied correctly. The `crossorigin` attribute
  removes sending cookies with the HTTP request and now there is a fallback to
  figure out the `remoteHost` even in this situation.

**Misc:**

- Support for redirects with status code `303`.
