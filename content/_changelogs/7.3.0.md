## 7.3.0

_Released 05/10/2021_

**Features:**

- Component tests can now be launched via the
  [Module API](/guides/guides/module-api) by passing `testingType: 'component'`
  via the new `testingType` property. The `testingType` will default to `e2e`.
  Addresses [#16302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16302).
- `cy.intercept()` now accepts a `times` option in the `RouteMatcher`. `times`
  will specify the number of times that a particular `cy.intercept()` should be
  applied. Addresses [#4460](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4460)
  and [#8531](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8531).
- `cy.intercept()` now accepts invocation using
  `cy.intercept(url, routeMatcher, handler)`, where `url` is a regular
  expression. Previously, this only worked if `url` was a string. Addresses
  [#16390](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16390).
- Cypress will now automatically get environment variables for LayerCI when
  recording to the Dashboard. Addresses
  [#16101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16101).
- Setting the env var `DEBUG=cypress:server:record:ci-info` will print commit
  information and CI provider information that's sent to the Dashboard as debug
  logs. Addresses [#16236](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16236).
- Cypress can now use the certificate authority specified in NPM config if
  `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_USE_CA` is specified. See
  ["Using a custom CA"](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Using-a-custom-CA)
  for more information. Addresses
  [#8825](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8825).

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress will no longer incorrectly redirect the AUT window to `/__/` when
  `location.href` is set to a relative path within the call stack of an XHR
  event handler. Fixes
  [#3975](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3975) and
  [#7439](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7439).
- Cypress now properly handles when a form submit or anchor tag target is set to
  `_top` or `_parent` so that it no longer redirects the parent frame. Fixes
  [#1244](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1244).
- Fixed a regression in [6.5.0](/guides/references/changelog#6-5-0) that could
  cause Cypress to crash with a
  `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded at _deconstructPacket` error.
  Most commonly, this occurred when handling network errors with `cy.request()`.
  Fixes [#15101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15101).
- Fixed a regression in [7.0.0](/guides/references/changelog#7-0-0) that caused
  the Test Runner to crash with an `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE` type error when
  testing a binary file upload. Fixes
  [#15898](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15898) and
  [#16223](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16223).
- When verifying Cypress, we now listen for the 'close' event instead of the
  'exit' event in an effort to fix some situations where the browser cannot be
  found even though it is on the system. Addressed in
  [#16312](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16312).
- Fixed a regression in [6.5.0](/guides/references/changelog#6-5-0) that caused
  a node warning about `.then()` only accepting functions to display. Fixes
  [#15281](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15281).
- `cy.intercept()` now adds a `access-control-expose-headers: '*'` header by
  default for CORS requests unless overridden. Fixes
  [#15050](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15050).
- Improved the way that `cy.intercept()` and `cy.route()` requests with multiple
  aliases are displayed in the command log. Addressed in
  [#16382](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16382).
- Cypress now correctly shows all `.should('contain')` assertions when chained
  after `.should('be.visible')`. Fixes
  [#16006](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16006).
- `Cypress.cookies.debug(true)` will now correctly show cookie-related messages
  on the console. Fixes
  [#15032](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15032).
- `cy.log()` will now show all arguments, not only the first 2. Fixes
  [#16068](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16068).
- `.select()` now correctly selects option elements with values that have
  `&nbsp;` characters. Fixes
  [#16045](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16045).
- The `e2e` and `component` configuration values will now correctly show when
  previewing resolved configuration in the Test Runner. Fixes
  [#16282](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16282).
- When passing the `â€”quiet` flag, Cypress will no longer print uploading output
  to Stdout. Fixes [#16268](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16268).
- When pressing the `/` hotkey in Firefox, Cypress will select the SpecList's
  SearchInput as it does in other browsers. Fixes
  [#16309](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16309).
- Cypress will now detect the default installation location of the Visual Studio
  Code editors on Windows machines. Fixes
  [#15080](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15080).
- Changing files extensions when creating a new test file should no longer add
  extra dots to the filename on Windows machines. Fixes
  [#16131](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16131).
