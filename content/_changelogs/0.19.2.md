## 0.19.2

*Released 04/16/2017*

**Features:**

- You can now run your tests in the [Electron browser](/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Electron-Browser) that comes built with Cypress. You will see it as an option in the browser dropdown. This is the same browser that Cypress uses when running `cypress run`. This is useful for debugging issues that only occur during headless runs. Addresses [#452](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/452).
- New traversal commands [`.nextAll()`](/api/commands/nextall), [`.nextUntil()`](/api/commands/nextuntil), [`.parentsUntil()`](/api/commands/parentsuntil), [`.prevAll()`](/api/commands/prevall), and [`.prevUntil()`](/api/commands/prevuntil) have been added. Addresses [#432](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/432).

**Bugfixes:**

- An error is now thrown if an `undefined` value is mistakenly passed into [`cy.wait()`](/api/commands/wait). Previously, it would set the command timeout to an unimaginably large number of ms. Fixes [#332](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/332)
- Fixed issue where the contents of `state.json` were emptied, which would cause a crash and loss of state information. Fixes [#473](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/473) and [#474](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/474).
- We no longer write the chrome extension within `node_modules`, and instead write this to the proper OS specific `appData` folder. Fixes [#245](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/245) and [#290](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/290).

**Misc:**

- Error handling for invalid arguments passed to [`cy.wait()`](/api/commands/wait) have been improved and will now suggest valid arguments that are acceptable.
- Browsers in the browser dropdown now have colored icons, which help visually distinguish the variants of Chrome.
- Increased timeout for browser to make a connection when running during `cypress run` from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.
- Internally refactored how browsers are added and spawned in preparation of us adding cross browser support.
- Switching specs in the GUI now closes the browser and respawns it and refocuses it.
