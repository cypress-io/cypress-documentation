## 7.6.0

_Released 06/21/2021_

**Features:**

- You can now override the default delay between characters for `cy.type()` with [`Cypress.Keyboard.defaults()`](https://on.cypress.io/keyboard-api) or via [test configuration](https://on.cypress.io/writing-and-organizing-tests#Allowed-config-values). Addresses [#566](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/566).

**Bugfixes:**

- It is no longer necessary to return the config from the plugins function when using the `dev-server:start` event for component testing. Fixes [#16860](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16860).
- Expanded the types for `CyHttpMessages.BaseMessage.headers` to support the value being an array of strings. Fixes [#16734](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16734).
- `cy.intercept()` now correctly sets the response body as a string instead of an ArrayBuffer when it contains multi-byte characters. Fixes [#16292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16292).
