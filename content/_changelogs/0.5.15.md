## 0.5.15

*Released 05/07/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- Reverted `window.location` overrides. This broke things in unexpected ways and after further testing would not have worked on `Firefox` and `IE`. It's back to the drawing board (but I have some ideas).  Apps using `pushState` routing are broken again.
