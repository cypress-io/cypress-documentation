## 9.4.0

_Released 1/31/2022_

**Features**

- Enhancements were made to `.selectFile()` after receiving feedback after its
  initial release in [9.3.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-3-0).
  - The default behavior was updated to automatically infer the mime type of
    files based on their extension to correctly encode file uploads. Addressed
    in [#19751](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19751).
  - Added the `mimeType` property so you can explicitly set the mime type on
    files using the `mimeType` property. Addressed in
    [#19751](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19751).
  - Updated file contents types to allow either a
    [`TypedArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray)
    instance or a `Cypress.Buffer` instance, where previously file contents were
    expected to only be an instance of `Cypress.Buffer`. Addressed in
    [#19751](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19751).
  - Updated `.selectFile()` to retain the fileName of files read from disk to
    work with aliases. Addressed in
    [#19803](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19803).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in [9.3.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-3-0) to correctly
  parse the `--spec` CLI parameter for glob patterns containing a range. Fixes
  [#19783](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19783).
- Fixed regression in [9.2.1](/guides/references/changelog#9-1-1) where the
  `--openssl-legacy-provider` flag was not being passed to the plugins' child
  process when the user's system Node version was Node 17+ built with OpenSSL
  v3+ which resulted in Cypress crashing when trying to run tests. Fixes
  [#19712](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19712).
- Update `.type('{enter}')` to align with the W3C standards where a click event
  should be dispatched when the Enter key is pressed and the current focus is on
  a state-changing element with type `button`, `image`, `submit` or `reset`.
  Fixes [#19541](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19541).
