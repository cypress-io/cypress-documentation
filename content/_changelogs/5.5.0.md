## 5.5.0

_Released 10/26/2020_

**Features:**

- [cy.viewport()](/api/commands/viewport) has a new `macbook-16` preset.
  Addresses [#8889](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8889).
- [.type()](/api/commands/type) now fires the `beforeInput` event during typing.
  _Note: Firefox does not support the `beforeinput` event_. Addresses
  [#7088](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7088).

**Bugfixes:**

- Updated the Cypress proxy layer to proxy HTTPS traffic from non-AUT origins.
  Addressed in [#8827](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/8827).
  - This fixed an issue with [`cy.route2()`](http) where HTTPS requests to a
    non-AUT origin would not be intercepted as expected.
- [`cy.route2()`](http) now properly handles passing a method as its first
  argument. Fixes [#8729](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8729).
- Fixed an issue with [`cy.route2()`](http) where a "Cannot set property
  response of undefined" error would occasionally occur. Fixes
  [#8858](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8858).
- Headers field names passed to [`cy.route2()`](http) now case-insensitively
  match against the field names of incoming HTTP requests. Fixes
  [#8921](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8921).
- Routes that stub fixtures for binary resources (including images) made with
  [`cy.route2()`](http) now serve the correct mime-type and content. Fixes
  [#8623](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8623).
- When [experimentalNetworkStubbing](/guides/references/experiments) is enabled,
  using [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) to URLs that redirect and set
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked will no longer fail in Cypress with a "Parse
  Error". Fixes [#8497](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8497).
- `cypress.run()` through the [Module API](/guides/guides/module-api) now has a
  `status` property in the results matching the correct CLI types (`"failed"` or
  `"finished"`). Addresses
  [#8798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8798).
- When a value containing an `e` character is passed to the `--ci-build-id`
  flag, Cypress now properly reads it as a string. Fixes
  [#8874](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8874).

**Misc:**

- Updated type definitions to allow for passed either `runMode` or `openMode` to
  `retries` alone. Addresses
  [#8869](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8869).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` from `10.1.3` to `10.1.5`. Addressed in
