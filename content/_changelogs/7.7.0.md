## 7.7.0

_Released 07/07/2021_

**Features:**

- When using `experimentalStudio`,
  [Cypress Studio](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-studio) can now copy all
  commands generated to your clipboard. Addressed in
  [#16912](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16912).

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress now respects `preventScroll` options passed to `element.focus()` calls
  within the application under test. Fixes
  [#15294](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15294).
- Using `.contains(0)` will now show the zero in the Command Log. Fixes
  [#1119](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1119).
- Cypress will no longer show a warning about allowed keys for the
  `showedOnBoardingModal` when running `cypress open`. Fixes
  [#17095](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17095).
- The Cypress Studio introduction modal will now display with the correct
  styling. Fixes [#17102](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17102).
- The types for `.contains()` now correctly allow for the `includeShadowDom`
  option. Fixes [#17066](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17066).

**Misc:**

- We updated the messaging when Cypress fails to start to be clearer that it's
  not always due to a dependency missing. Addresses
  [#17112](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/17112).
