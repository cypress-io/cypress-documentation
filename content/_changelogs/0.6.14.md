## 0.6.14

*Released 06/11/2015*

**Features:**

- Command logging has been upgraded to support "page events", which are different than commands. Now events which happen (XHR/page load/url change/spies/stubs/mocks) log out visually differently and do not use a command number. This should be easier to parse what was a real command and what was a page event.
- When the url changes this is now logged as a page event, and its `onConsole` logs what caused it to change.

**Misc:**

- Internal refactor / improvements to support long lived runnable objects to work with page events.
- Request Commands (now page events) have now been renamed to 'XHR'.
- [`cy.document()`](/api/commands/document) now returns the raw document object instead of a jQuery wrapped document object.
- When [`.its()`](/api/commands/its) or [`.invoke()`](/api/commands/invoke) fails it will include the current subject n the `onConsole` log.
- [`cy.wait()`](/api/commands/wait) now logs out when its referenced aliases, and its `onConsole` output displays the XHR return values.
- [`cy.hash()`](/api/commands/hash) and [`cy.url()`](/api/commands/url) no longer pass the return value as the command log's `message`, which made no sense and was unlike every other command.
