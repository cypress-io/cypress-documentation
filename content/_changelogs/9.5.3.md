## 9.5.3

_Released 3/28/2022_

**Bugfixes:**

- Corrected a logging issue with `cy.intercept()` where the response status code
  and response body were sometimes missing from the log details in `open` mode.
  Fixed [#18757](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18757).
- Fixed an issue in `cy.readFile()` where the command would not retry or provide
  a meaningful error message if `null` encoding was used and the file was not
  found. Fixed [#20683](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20683).
- Updated the Cypress Keyboard shortcuts to only run the shortcut when the
  pressed shortcut key was not used in conjunction with either the `alt`,
  `ctrl`, or `shift` modifier keys. This fixed an issue where the Cypress
  shortcut handler would override the browser native keyboard shortcut for
  search (`ctrl + f`). Fixed
  [#20222](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20222).
- Updates were made to correctly escape dollar signs in the
  `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE` environment variable. Issues were seen
  utilizing this template when the env was provided from a package manager file.
  Fixed [#19914](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19914).
- Fix the `Cypress.Buffer` TypeScript type to reference the static constructor
  of `Buffer`, instead of incorrectly referencing the `Buffer` instance which
  caused Type errors. Fixes
  [#20542](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20542).
