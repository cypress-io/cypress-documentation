## 0.11.8

_Released 09/25/2015_

**Features:**

- Added [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) command which can issue XHR requests. The request is generated outside of the browser, and bypasses all CORS restrictions. Great for talking to an API for seeding, querying, building, etc.

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevented edge case with [`cy.fixture()`](/api/commands/fixture) where it would not be able to be canceled without throwing an unhandled rejection error.
