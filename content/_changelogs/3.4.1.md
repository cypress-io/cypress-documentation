## 3.4.1

_Released 7/29/2019_

**Dashboard Features:**

- We’re excited to announce
  [GitHub integration](/guides/dashboard/github-integration) for the
  [Cypress Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard). You can now get timely
  and useful test run information within pull-requests via status checks and
  pull-request comments. Learn all about it on
  [our blog](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/07/29/github-integration-for-the-cypress-dashboard/).
  Addresses [#981](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/981).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a bug where the content of pages using non-UTF-8 character encoding
  would become corrupted when opened in Cypress. Fixes
  [#3479](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3479),
  [#1543](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1543), and
  [#3650](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3650).
- Fixed a regression introduced in [3.4.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-4-0)
  that caused an error to be thrown when chaining together multiple assertions
  using the `and` chainable getter. Fixes
  [#4833](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4833).
- The `include` and `includes` assertion chainers now correctly work the same as
  `contain` and `contains` assertion chainers. Fixes
  [#4833](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4833).
- Cypress now correctly works offline on Windows when visiting a localhost URL.
  Fixes [#4763](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4763).
- [cy.type()](/api/commands/type) now factors in the `readonly` property of
  `<input />` elements, and will wait for this property to be `false` before
  attempting to type. Fixes
  [#1246](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1246).
- Variables beginning with `top` and `location` in your application code are no
  longer modified when `modifyObstructiveCode` is `true`. Fixes
  [#4794](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4794).
- We removed erroneous socket connections when the browser is initially
  launching. Fixes [#4776](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4776).
- Fixed a bug when dismissing pinned snapshots that would cause the page to be
  wiped with nothing rendered. Fixes
  [#4864](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4864).
- We upgraded the `mocha-teamcity-reporter` dependency so that it no longer
  errors in certain situations when trying to access duration on tests. Fixes
  [#4654](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4654).
- We upgraded the `lodash` dependency to fix a security vulnerability warning.
  Fixes [#4699](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4699),
  [#4730](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4730),
  [#4743](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4743).

**Misc:**

- We now ensure we are shipping with production versions of dependencies such as
  `react`, `mobx`, etc. This should help to prevent conflicts with Developer
  Tools extensions and increase performance by reducing memory, heap allocation,
  and overall JS bundle size. Addresses
  [#4844](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4844).
- Video recordings now wait after all tests finish to ensure that the video
  captures the final rendered frames of the browser. This prevents the last few
  paints from being cut off. Fixes
  [#2370](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2370).
- Cypress now looks for any npm proxy configuration values as a fallback when no
  other system proxy configuration is found. This brings this feature into
  parity with how npm reads off proxy configuration values during an
  `npm install`. Addresses
  [#4719](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4719).
- We updated the messaging when there is a failure downloading Cypress to
  recommend checking your proxy settings. Addresses
  [#1662](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1662).
- A warning message now displays if you attempt to run the Cypress binary
  directly instead of going through the cypress `npm` package. Addresses
  [#1573](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1573).
- There are newly added examples in the TypeScript definitions for
  [custom commands](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands),
  [cy.location()](/api/commands/location) and [.should()](/api/commands/should).
  Addresses [#3684](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3684) and
  [#4715](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4715).
- The types for the [`cy.contains(content, options)`](/api/commands/contains)
  syntax have been added. Addresses
  [#4727](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4727).
- Types for `cy.once()` have been added. Addressed in
  [#4788](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4788).
- There is now a `{ parseSpecialCharSequences: false }` option to
  [cy.type()](/api/commands/type) that disables parsing the special character
  sequences found between the `{}` characters. This will now type what you've
  provided literally without any special parsing. Fixes
  [#4287](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4287).
- You can now zoom in the main Test Runner window and also the Electron browser.
  Corresponding keyboard shortcuts for Zoom in, Zoom out and Actual Size are
  also available. Addresses
  [#1231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1231).
- When viewing the Test Runner's main window at its smallest size, the header
  text no longer incorrectly wraps. Addresses
  [#86](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/86).
- We're continuing to make process in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript
  to JavaScript. Addresses
  [#2690](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2690) in
  [#4781](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4781) and
  [#4817](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4817).
- We increased the cypress binary verification phase from 10 seconds to 30
  seconds to accommodate underpowered or overwhelmed machines typically found in
  CI environments. Addresses
  [#4624](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4624).

  [GitHub Integration](/guides/dashboard/github-integration) with the Cypress
