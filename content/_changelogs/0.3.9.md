## 0.3.9

_Released 03/24/2015_

**Features:**

- Instead of waiting until commands resolve, commands are immediately inserted with a `pending` status.
- Pending commands are now visually distinguishable.
- Created new `Cypress.Log` interface for greater control over the display of commands.
- Available aliases are now logged in the console on [`.debug()`](/api/commands/debug).

**Bugfixes:**

- Allow projects to be scrolled when >4 are added.
- [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) accepts remaining `input[type=*]` that users can type into.
- Cause + Effect commands are now logged in the correct order. IE, clicking something which causes another command to insert will be inserted correctly in the order they arrived
- `numRetries` is no longer shown in commands.
- [`.clear()`](/api/commands/clear) now logs a command.
- `Promise.reduce` bugs are now fixed, causing events on a collection of elements in the synchronous wrong order.
- `cy.chain` is now coercively returned instead of `cy` which prevents losing access to the subject in custom commands.
- Trailing slashes are removed when serving initial files from the file system directly.
