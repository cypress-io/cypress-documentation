## 9.5.4

_Released 4/11/2022_

**Bugfixes:**

- Updates were made to silence Electron warnings related to being unable to
  connect to dbus. These errors are normal and expected, and do not result in
  test failures. Because they are always present when running Electron inside
  docker containers, it has incorrectly led people to believe it is the
  root-cause of an error within their test run. By silencing these errors, it
  will improve the debug experience to allow users to focus on meaningful
  warning and error messages. Fixed
  [#19299](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19299).
- Updates were made to ensure that all `*.enabled` events are sent if Cypress
  becomes disconnected from the Chrome DevTools Protocol and must re-establish a
  connection to ensure all command logs are displayed to the user. This fixes an
  issue where some command logs, like download or network events, are missing
  once Cypress has disconnected and then reconnected to the Chrome DevTools
  Protocol. Fixed [#20618](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20618).
- Fixed an issue where `cy.type('{enter}')` was not sending the Enter key for
  Firefox `v98+`. This was not an issue with Firefox `v97` and below. Fixed
  [#20562](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20562).
- Fixed a regression in [9.3.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-3-0) where glob
  patterns provided to the `--spec` CLI parameter was incorrectly splitting the
  patterns in unexpected places when it should have split on commas. Fixes
  [#20794](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20794).
- Fixed an issue with `cy.root()` to respect the
  [`timeout`](/api/commands/root#Arguments) option passed to the command.
  Previously, when the `timeout` option was provided, it was ignored and the
  default timeout was used. Fixed
  [#19985](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19985).
- Updates were made to decrease the length of the Cypress cache path for Windows
  to ensure
  [installing pre-release versions](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Install-pre-release-version)
  of the Cypress binary are within the maximum path length of 260 characters.
  Fixed in [#20961](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pulls/20961).
- Fixed a regression in [9.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-2-0) which would
  sometimes throw an expected error on navigation with `cy.back()` and
  `cy.go()`. Fixed [#19749](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19749)
  and [#20539](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20539).
- Corrected the Typescript type for a cookie which was incorrectly typed as
  `any` when the correct type is `Cookie`. Fixed in
  [#20513](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20513).
- Added the missing `Cypress.Command.addAll()` Typescript types. Fixed
  [#18886](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issue/18886).
- Fixed an uncommon error observed in `cy.session()` where an error was thrown
  when no cookies had been set for the session and the user clicks the session
  command log to view additional details in the DevTools console. Fixed in
  [#20946](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20946).

**Misc:**

- A minor visual update was made to the `cy.session()` command log visuals.
