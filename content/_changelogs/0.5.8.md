## 0.5.8

_Released 04/24/2015_

**Features:**

- [`.as()`](/api/commands/as) can now alias primitives and objects other than
  routes or DOM.
- [`.as()`](/api/commands/as) automatically assigns this alias to `runnable.ctx`
  which makes it available synchronously.
- [`.as()`](/api/commands/as) does not allow several reserved words and will
  throw if you attempt to alias as one of them.
- [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get) can now accept all alias types and will
  display the labels in the UI differently based on the alias type.
- Cypress now displays a message when the Desktop App update is actually being
  applied instead of doing nothing and looking like it's crashed.

**Bugfixes:**

- [`.as()`](/api/commands/as) now throws on empty strings or non string
  arguments.
- Desktop App debug logs no longer sort in the wrong direction.
- Permissions are now restored during a cypress update for the `logs` and
  `cache`.
- Prevent 3rd party windows from gaining focus over main window.

**Misc:**

- Removed `cy.assign`, this has been folded into [`.as()`](/api/commands/as).
- Updated `chokidar` to `1.0.1`.
