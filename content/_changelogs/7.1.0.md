## 7.1.0

_Released 04/12/2021_

**Features:**

- The events `before:spec`, `after:spec`, `before:run`, and `after:run` now fire
  in interactive mode in addition to run mode. This requires the
  `experimentalInteractiveRunEvents` flag to be enabled. Addressed in
  [#15787](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15787).

**Bugfixes:**

- Viewport configuration set in `cypress.json` is now correctly applied in the
  Component Test Runner. Fixes
  [#15899](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15899).
- Running specs on Windows is now supported in the Component Test Runner. Fixes
  [#15842](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15842).
- Fixed an issue where crashes in Cypress would cause a misleading "Unknown
  signal: true" error after the actual crash message. Fixes
  [#15943](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15943).
- Fixed an issue introduced in 7.0.0 where requests with responses stubbed via
  `cy.intercept(routeMatcher, staticResponse)` would still be sent to the
  destination server. Fixes
  [#15841](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15841).
