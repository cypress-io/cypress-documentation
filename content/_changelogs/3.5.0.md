## 3.5.0

_Released 10/23/2019_

**Features:**

- We now record video by default when you run Cypress in Chrome, Chromium, or
  Canary such as during
  [cypress run --browser chrome](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-browser-lt-browser-name-or-path-gt).
  Addresses [#4608](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4608).
- There is a new [.rightclick()](/api/commands/rightclick) command to right
  click on DOM elements. Addresses
  [#53](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/53).
- Cypress now accepts a
  [`--config-file` argument](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-config-file-lt-config-file-gt)
  to specify a different file to be used for Cypress configuration. You can also
  pass `false` to the `--config-file` to not use any configuration file.
  Addresses [#1369](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1369).
- You can now use your system's Node version by setting the
  [nodeVersion](/guides/references/configuration#Node-version) to `system` in
  your configuration. This Node version will be used to build files in your
  [integrationFolder](/guides/references/configuration#Folders-Files) and
  [supportFile](/guides/references/configuration#Folders-Files) and also be used
  to execute code in your
  [pluginsFile](/guides/references/configuration#Folders-Files). If not set,
  Cypress will continue to use the Node version bundled with Cypress. Addresses
  [#4432](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4432).
- [.dblclick()](/api/commands/dblclick) now accepts `position`, `x`, and `y`
  arguments. Addresses [#116](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/116).
- [.dblclick()](/api/commands/dblclick) now accepts `force` and `multiple` in
  its `options`. Addresses
  [#116](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/116).
- [.screenshot()](/api/commands/screenshot) now accepts a `padding` argument
  when screenshotting elements that will alter the dimensions of the screenshot
  of the element. Addresses
  [#4440](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4440).
- [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) now accepts a `qs` option representing an
  object of query parameters to be used in the URL. Addresses
  [#5034](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5034).
- [cy.viewport()](/api/commands/viewport) now allows for viewport sizes up to
  4,000 pixels. Addresses
  [#5181](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5181).
- [cy.viewport()](/api/commands/viewport) accepts new size presets for
  `iphone-xr`, `iphone-x`, `samsung-s10` and `samsung-note9`. Addresses
  [#4967](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4967).
- Passing a `~` to `CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER` will automatically resolve to the
  user's home directory. Addresses
  [#5386](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5386).

  [#1746](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1746).
- We now normalize the Cypress cache folder to resolve in the current folder and
  not with respect to the `node_modules/cypress` folder. Fixes

**Misc:**

- Cypress now displays a more precise error message when checking an element's
  visibility if an element is detached from the DOM. Addresses
  [#4946](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4946).
- We increased the timeout to wait for Xvfb to start from 5 seconds to 30
  seconds. This should resolve some issues where the error
  `Could not start Xvfb` was being thrown because Xvfb could not start within
  the allowed time. Addresses
  [#5110](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5110).
- We now warn when using `cypress run` from the binary directly (not from an npm
  module) since this is not its intended use. Addresses
  [#1573](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1573).
- We now warn on [`cy.visit('file://...)`](/api/commands/visit) to explain that
  this url format is not supported and suggest visiting a relative HTML file.
  Addresses [#4452](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4452).
- Setting the reserved `CYPRESS_ENV` environment variable will now throw an
  error. Addresses [#1621](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1621).

  [browser](/api/plugins/browser-launch-api) argument of the Browser Launch API
  explaining that a String is expected instead. Addresses
  [#4966](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4966).
- An error will now be thrown if an invalid `name` or `value` is supplied to
  [cy.setCookie()](/api/commands/setcookie), matching the RFC 6265 compliant
  validation of cookie names and values. Addresses
  [#5206](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5206).
- Passing an invalid type to the 2nd argument of [cy.get()](/api/commands/get)
  now throws an error explaining that an `options` Object is expected. Addresses
  [#2953](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2953).
- We now throw a more helpful error message during
  [cy.screenshot()](/api/commands/screenshot) that would result in a screenshot
  with 0 width or height. Addresses
  [#5149](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5149).
- Stdout printed during `cypress run` no longer truncates text such a filenames
  and instead wraps the text to fit within the width of the terminal. Addresses
  [#4977](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4977).
- We now display up to 2,000 characters of HTTP property values within error
  messages during [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) errors. Addresses
  [#3145](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3145).
- Cypress now always considers `localhost` to be in `NO_PROXY`. To make Cypress
  send traffic for `localhost` through the proxy, you will now have to pass
  `<-loopback>` in `NO_PROXY`. Addresses
  [#4780](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4780).
- We changed the way cookies are set in [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) to
  more closely match the browser's behavior when setting cookies, particularly
  when using `fetch` with cookies. Addresses
  [#4433](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4433).
- We've added more flags to send to Chrome upon launch that should help with
  issues encountered during browser automation including
  `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-window`, `--disable-breakpad`,
  `--disable-ipc-flooding-protection`, `--password-store=basic`, and
  `--use-mock-keychain`. Addresses

  [#3633](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3633).

  scrolls the search and filter bar. Addresses
  [#4904](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4904).

  [3.4.1](/guides/references/changelog#3-4-1). Addresses

  an `options` object as an argument. Addresses
  [#5341](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5341).
- We added `failures` and `message` types when a run fails using the
  [Module API](/guides/guides/module-api). Addresses
  [#5335](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5335).
- We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript
  to JavaScript. Addresses
