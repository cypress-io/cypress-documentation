## 0.19.1

_Released 03/09/2017_

**Features:**

- Added `Cypress.version` property. Fixes [#404](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/404).
- Selecting `<option>` inside `<optgroup>` now works with [`.select()`](/api/commands/select). Fixes [#367](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/367).

**Bugfixes:**

- `EMFILE` errors have been fixed. These were being caused due to `ulimit` being too low on your OS. This should fix the file watching problems people were having. Essentially we just replaced `fs` with `graceful-fs` and crossed our fingers this works. (It did on our machines). Fixes [#369](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/369).
- Now you can select the error text in the GUI. Fixes [#344](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/344).
- Cypress now correctly re-bundles files even when `watchForFileChanges` is set to `false`. Fixes [#446](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/446) and [#347](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/347).
- Fixed file watching when changing the `integrationFolder` to something other than the default value. Fixes [#438](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/438).
- [`.select()`](/api/commands/select) now works on options that have the same value. Fixes [#441](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/441).
- Cypress no longer crashes when you click links in the on-boarding screen called "To help you get started...". Fixes [#227](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/227).
- The `example_spec.js` file that gets seeded on a new project no longer fails on [`cy.readFile()`](/api/commands/readfile). Fixes [#414](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/414).

**Misc:**

- We now preserve the Test Runner's position and sizing after it's closed + reopened. Fixes [#443](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/443).
- We now ignore watching `node_modules`, `bower_components` and a few other folders to reduce the number of watched files. Fixes [#437](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/437).
