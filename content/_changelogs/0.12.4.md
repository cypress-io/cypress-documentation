## 0.12.4

_Released 11/19/2015_

**Features:**

- There is a new [`Cypress.Cookies`](/api/cypress-api/cookies) interface which
  enables you to `get`, `set`, and even `preserve` cookies throughout your test.
  Useful to preserve cookie-based sessions between your tests.
  [Documentation is written here](/api/cypress-api/cookies).

**Bugfixes:**

- Removed problematic `content-security-policy` headers
- Fixed situation where Cypress was not injected correctly when `<head>` tag had
  attributes
- Prevent fixtures from being accidentally overwritten and having their content
  blanked out. There was a very subtle chance due to node's async file writing
  that as a file was being written with a formatted fixture, that another call
  to the same fixture would read in at that exact moment. If this happened the
  2nd read would resolve with zero bytes, which would then end up rewriting the
  file back with zero bytes.

**Misc:**

- `alerts` are automatically accepted now and a message logs to the console.
- Added retina favicon. Fixes
  [#83](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/83).
- Removed nested `cypress` object in the `cypress.json`. Existing `cypress.json`
  files are transparently rewritten on the next server boot, so you can check in
  the modified `cypress.json` and all will be well. Fixes
  [#82](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/82).
- Improved performance of formatting fixtures.
