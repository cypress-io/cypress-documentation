## 0.12.4

*Released 11/19/2015*

**Features:**

- There is a new [`Cypress.Cookies`](/api/cypress-api/cookies) interface which enables you to `get`, `set`, and even `preserve` cookies throughout your test. Useful to preserve cookie-based sessions between your tests. [Documentation is written here](/api/cypress-api/cookies).

**Bugfixes:**

- Removed problematic `content-security-policy` headers
- Fixed situation where Cypress was not injected correctly when `<head>` tag had attributes
- Prevent fixtures from being accidentally overwritten and having their content blanked out. There was a very subtle chance due to node's async file writing that as a file was being written with a formatted fixture, that another call to the same fixture would read in at that exact moment. If this happened the 2nd read would resolve with zero bytes, which would then end up rewriting the file back with zero bytes.

**Misc:**

- `alerts` are automatically accepted now and a message logs to the console.
- Added retina favicon. Fixes [#83](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/83).
- Removed nested `cypress` object in the `cypress.json`. Existing `cypress.json` files are transparently rewritten on the next server boot, so you can check in the modified `cypress.json` and all will be well. Fixes [#82](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/82).
- Improved performance of formatting fixtures.
