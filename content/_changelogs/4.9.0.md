## 4.9.0

*Released 6/23/2020*

**Features:**

- An animated progress bar now displays on every command in the [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Command-Log) indicating how long the command has left to run before reaching its command timeout. Addresses [#7642](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7642).
- There is now an [experimentalFetchPolyfill](/guides/references/experiments) configuration option. When this option is `true`, Cypress will automatically replace `window.fetch` with a polyfill that Cypress can spy on and stub. Addresses [#7710](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7710).
- You can now pass a `--quiet` flag to [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) to silence any Cypress specific output from stdout. Addresses [#7714](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7714).

**Bugfixes:**

- [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait) now correctly resolves when waiting for XHR requests that contain resource-like text in the XHR's query params or hash (like `.js`, .`html`, `.css`). [#7280](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7280).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "4.6.0" changelog-4-6-0 %} where errors thrown from the application under test as strings would not be correctly handled. Fixes [#7590](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7590).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "4.8.0" changelog-4-8-0 %} where [.click()](/api/commands/click) would hang if the subject had a shadow root and [experimentalShadowDomSupport](/guides/references/experiments#Shadow-DOM) was not enabled. Fixes [#7679](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7679).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "4.6.0" changelog-4-6-0 %} so that [`.should('have.value')`](/api/commands/should) now properly asserts against `<progress>`, `<meter>` or `<li>` element's values. Fixes [#7603](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7603).
- Cypress no longer responds with 413 responses during a recorded `cypress run` when the stdout is too large. Fixes [#7548](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7548).
- We fixed an issue where Cypress could exit successfully even with failing tests when launched in global mode. Fixes [#7755](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7755).
- Assertion logs now properly display as parent commands in the [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Command-Log) regardless of what is in the `beforeEach` hook. Fixes [#7731](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7731).
- When [experimentalShadowDomSupport](/guides/references/experiments#Shadow-DOM) is enabled, querying shadow dom in certain situations will no longer cause the error `Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` during `cypress run`. Fixes [#7676](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7676).
- Highlighting of elements upon hover of a command in the [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Command-Log) are now visible when targeting absolute positioned elements. Fixes [#7762](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7762).
- [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) will no longer crash when provided an empty string to the `--project` flag. Fixes [#7743](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7743).

**Misc:**

- There is now a loading state to indicate when tests are loading in the [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Command-Log). Addresses [#7700](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7700).
- The type definitions for `fixturesFolder`, `pluginsFile`, `screenshotsFolders` and `videoCompression` have been updated to allow `false` TypeScript types. Addresses [#7654](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7654).
- The type definitions for `cy.wait(ms)` now correctly yield the type of the previous subject. Addresses [#7682](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7682).
- The type definitions now allow for the 'key' keyword when chaining off 'any' or 'all' assertion chainers. Addresses [#7665](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7665).
