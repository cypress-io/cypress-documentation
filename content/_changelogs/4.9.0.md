## 4.9.0

_Released 6/23/2020_

**Features:**

- An animated progress bar now displays on every command in the
  [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) indicating how
  long the command has left to run before reaching its command timeout.
  Addresses [#7642](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7642).
- There is now an [experimentalFetchPolyfill](/guides/references/experiments)
  configuration option. When this option is `true`, Cypress will automatically
  replace `window.fetch` with a polyfill that Cypress can spy on and stub.
  Addresses [#7710](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7710).
- You can now pass a `--quiet` flag to
  [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) to silence any Cypress
  specific output from stdout. Addresses
  [#7714](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7714).

**Bugfixes:**

- [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait) now correctly resolves when waiting for XHR
  requests that contain resource-like text in the XHR's query params or hash
  (like `.js`, .`html`, `.css`).
  [#7280](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7280).
- We fixed a regression in [4.6.0](#4-6-0) where errors thrown from the
  application under test as strings would not be correctly handled. Fixes
  [#7590](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7590).
- We fixed a regression in [4.8.0](#4-8-0) where [.click()](/api/commands/click)
  would hang if the subject had a shadow root and
  [experimentalShadowDomSupport](/guides/references/experiments#Shadow-DOM) was
  not enabled. Fixes [#7679](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7679).
- We fixed a regression in [4.6.0](#4-6-0) so that
  [`.should('have.value')`](/api/commands/should) now properly asserts against
  `<progress>`, `<meter>` or `<li>` element's values. Fixes
  [#7603](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7603).
- Cypress no longer responds with 413 responses during a recorded `cypress run`
  when the stdout is too large. Fixes
  [#7548](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7548).
- We fixed an issue where Cypress could exit successfully even with failing
  tests when launched in global mode. Fixes
  [#7755](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7755).
- Assertion logs now properly display as parent commands in the
  [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) regardless of
  what is in the `beforeEach` hook. Fixes
  [#7731](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7731).
- When [experimentalShadowDomSupport](/guides/references/experiments#Shadow-DOM)
  is enabled, querying shadow dom in certain situations will no longer cause the
  error `Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` during `cypress run`. Fixes
  [#7676](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7676).
- Highlighting of elements upon hover of a command in the
  [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) are now visible
  when targeting absolute positioned elements. Fixes
  [#7762](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7762).
- [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) will no longer crash
  when provided an empty string to the `--project` flag. Fixes
  [#7743](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7743).

**Misc:**

- There is now a loading state to indicate when tests are loading in the
  [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log). Addresses
  [#7700](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7700).
- The type definitions for `fixturesFolder`, `pluginsFile`, `screenshotsFolders`
  and `videoCompression` have been updated to allow `false` TypeScript types.
  Addresses [#7654](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7654).
- The type definitions for `cy.wait(ms)` now correctly yield the type of the
  previous subject. Addresses
  [#7682](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7682).
- The type definitions now allow for the 'key' keyword when chaining off 'any'
  or 'all' assertion chainers. Addresses
  [#7665](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7665).
