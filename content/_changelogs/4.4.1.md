## 4.4.1

*Released 4/20/2020*

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress can now launch on systems where Chromium is installed via Snapcraft. Fixes [#7020](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7020).
- We now check whether the `mouseup` event's target element is detached before issuing the `click` event during [.click()](/api/commands/click). Fixes [#6923](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6923).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.8.1" changelog-3-8-1 %} where the Test Runner could send an `undefined` organization ID during project setup when the default organization is preselected. Fixes [#7013](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7013).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "4.4.0" changelog-4.4.0 %} that caused projects to include bundled TypeScript. Fixes [#7036](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7036).
- Fixed an issue where sites that set `Feature-Policy: document-domain 'none'` headers would fail to load in Cypress. Fixes [#6480](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6480).

**Misc:**

- We fixed some extra spacing displaying below the project nav in the Test Runner. Addresses [#7023](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7023)
- The typings for run results when using the [Module API](/guides/guides/module-api) now indicate they can be `null` or `undefined`. Addresses [#6126](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6126).
- We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses [#2690](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2690) in [#7004](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7004).
