## 12.0.0

_Released MM/DD/YYYY_

**Breaking Changes:**

- `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` flag has been removed and all functionality is
  on by default now.
- The new concept of `testIsolation` has been introduced and it defaults to
  `on`.
- Cypress now throws an error if commands are invoked from inside a `.should()`
  callback. This previously resulted in unusual and undefined behavior; it is
  now explicitly an error. <<<<<<< HEAD =======
- The [`.within()`](/api/commands/within) command now throws an error if given
  more than one DOM element as a subject. This is done for consistency - in
  older versions, some commands inside a `.within()` block would respect all
  passed in elements, while others silently discarded subjects beyond the first
  and `.screenshot()` would throw an error.

- `Cookies.defaults` and `Cookies.preserveOnce` have been removed. Please update
  to use [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) to preserve session details
  between tests. Addresses
  [#21472](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21472).
- The` cy.server()` and` cy.route()` commands and the `Cypress.Server.defaults`
  API has been removed. Use [`cy.intercept()`(/api/commands/intercept) instead.
  Addressed in [#24411](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24411).
