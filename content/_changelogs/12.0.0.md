**Breaking Changes:**

  on by default now.
- The new concept of `testIsolation` has been introduced and it defaults to
  `on`.

  to use [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) to preserve session details
  between tests. Addresses
  [#21472](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21472).
- The` cy.server()` and` cy.route()` commands and the `Cypress.Server.defaults`
