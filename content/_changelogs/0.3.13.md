## 0.3.13

_Released 03/27/2015_

**Features:**

- [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) now detects a local url. `localhost`,

**Bugfixes:**

- [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) now properly escape quotes in the
  text.
- [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) now inserts a trailing slash intelligently
  into the correct `path` position (not after query params or hashes).
- [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) will no longer log 2 failed commands on
  error.
- Hovering on commands which delay resolving their $el will now properly
  highlight again.

**Misc:**

- [`.debug()`](/api/commands/debug) returns the current subject now.
- upgraded jsUri to `1.3.0`.
- [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) now throws when url argument isn't a
  string.
- `Cypress.Log` instances now fire `attrs:changed` event. Removed `state:change`
  event.
