## 9.7.0

_Released 5/23/2022_

**Features:**

- The Electron version and shipped Chromium browser version has been updated.
  Addressed in [#21418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21418).

**Deprecations:**

- The `Cypress.Cookies.preserveOnce()` and `Cypress.Cookies.defaults()` Cypress
  APIs have been deprecated. In a future release, support for
  `Cypress.Cookies.preserveOnce()` and `Cypress.Cookies.defaults()` will be
  removed. Consider using the experimental
  [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) command instead to cache and restore
  cookies and other sessions details between tests. Fixed
  [#21333](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21333).

**Bugfixes:**

- Updated the [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) command to correctly
  error and retry if the provided regex pattern begins with an equal sign and a
  match was not initially found. Previously the command would incorrectly fail
  with a syntax error. Fixed
  [#21108](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21108).
- Corrected the `cy.session()` command log grouping and validation verbiage.
  This change provides better insights to logs associated with the command.
  Fixed [#21377](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21377).
- Removed `eventemitter2` third-party type definitions from `cy` and `Cypress`
  that were unintentionally exposed. Fixed
  [#20556](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20556).

**Dependency Updates:**

  `16.13.2`. Addressed in
  [#21418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21418).
- Upgraded the Chromium browser version used during `cypress run` and when
  selecting Electron browser in `cypress open` from `94.0.4606.81` to
  `100.0.4896.75`. Addressed in
  [#21418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21418).
