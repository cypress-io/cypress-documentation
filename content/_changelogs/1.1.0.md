## 1.1.0

_Released 11/19/2017_

**Summary:**

- We have officially launched the new **Plugins API** interface. This adds a `cypress/plugins/index.js` file to new and existing projects. Using this file will enable you to modify the internals of Cypress running in the background `node` process. This means you will be able to use `node` APIs that are executed outside of the browser.
- We have currently added only [one event](/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin#List-of-events) for modifying the test file preprocessor, but this paves the way for adding many more event types. You can now modify every aspect of how files are sent to the browser.
- We have extracted the default Browserify preprocessor into its own package - [`@cypress/browserify-preprocessor`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-browserify-preprocessor). This is bundled with Cypress, but it is extracted so it can be used / modified by you to change the default options we pass to Browserify. Additionally, you can swap out this preprocessor for something else entirely.

**Features:**

- There is now a [Plugins API interface](/guides/tooling/plugins-guide). Partially addresses [#684](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/684).
- We have added the first Plugin API event called: [file:preprocessor](/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin#List-of-events). Fixes [#580](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/580) and [#581](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/581).
- You can now customize the default Babe; configuration options for the Browserify preprocessor. Fixes [#343](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/343) and [#905](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/905).
- CoffeeScript 2 is supported via modifying the default options for the Browserify preprocessor. Fixes [#663](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/663).
- You can swap out or extend the default preprocessor to do exotic things like compile ClojureScript into JavaScript. Fixes [#533](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/533).
- We have created a [`@cypress/webpack-preprocessor`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/master/npm/webpack-preprocessor) preprocessor npm package for you webpack users (because we are nice ￰ ﾟﾘﾉ). Fixes [#676](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/676).

**Bugfixes:**

- [`cy.contains(selector, regexp)`](/api/commands/contains) now works as intended. Fixes [#801](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/801).
- We no longer format fixtures in any capacity. This fixes a bug with improperly formatting fixtures in Windows. You should handle formatting fixtures yourself. Fixes [#884](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/884) and [#902](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/902).
- [cy.viewport()](/api/commands/viewport) resolves if only width or only height changes. Fixes [#873](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/873).
- Cypress now auto reloads when spec files are modified in Windows. Fixes [#712](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/712).

**Misc:**

- There is a new `--global` option useful with [cypress open](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) to force Cypress to open in global mode. This is helpful when you have multiple nested Cypress projects but only want to install Cypress once in the root project. Fixes [#889](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/889).
- The [module API](/guides/guides/module-api) accepts `reporterOptions` as an object literal like it does for the `env` and `config` properties. Fixes [#899](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/899).
