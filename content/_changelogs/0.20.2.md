## 0.20.2

_Released 10/06/2017_

**Possibly Breaking Changes:**

- [cy.exec()](/api/commands/exec) now trims output by default. That means if you were using an `eq` assertion the output will no longer have a trailing newline character `\n`. It's unlikely you are doing this, but it is possible you may need to update your assertions to remove this character. Fixes [#697](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/697).

**Bugfixes:**

- Handle errors gracefully when Electron window has been closed before paint events happen. Fixes [#705](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/705).
- Basic auth now works _again_. Fixes [#573](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/573).
- [cy.exec()](/api/commands/exec) now properly sources each time it is invoked instead of only once. Fixes [#694](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/694).

**Misc:**

- `cypress open` now accepts the `--project` flag which enables you to use a root level Cypress installation and point to multiple sub projects. Fixes [#661](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/661).
- Prevent newer versions of Chrome from prompting you to save passwords and suppressed other extension related popups for Windows. Fixes [#704](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/704).
