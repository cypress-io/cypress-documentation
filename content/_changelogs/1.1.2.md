## 1.1.2

*Released 11/26/2017*

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression caused by [.type()](/api/commands/type) adhering to `maxlength` incorrectly. Special character sequences were not respected. Now [.type()](/api/commands/type) works with special characters and implements a complete fix for `maxlength`. In addition to it working, it now fires all applicable browser events without modifying the actual input value. Fixes [#955](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/955).
- Errors coming from plugins now display correctly in the Test Runner. Fixes [#945](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/945).
