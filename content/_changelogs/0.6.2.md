## 0.6.2

_Released 05/20/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- Using the `length` option in `querying` or `traversal` commands now logs out
  in the Command Log. Fixes
  [#40](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/40).
- Other scenarios are fixed where command options would show incorrect number of
  object keys due to a bug in underscore's `reduce` with an object that has a
  `length` key. Fixes [#35](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/35).
