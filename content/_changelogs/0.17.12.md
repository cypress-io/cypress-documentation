## 0.17.12

_Released 11/21/2016_

**Bugfixes:**

- You no longer have to log in again after updating. Fixes [#305](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/305).
- Updating in app now works again. Sorry about that. Fixes [#304](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/304).
- Headless frame rate is now correctly set to `20` instead of resetting back to `60`. Fixes [#303](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/303).
- We now automatically drop frames that the CPU cannot keep up with while video recording during `cypress run`. Previously we would buffer all frames in memory and it was possible to exhaust all memory due to the way that streaming backpressure works. Fixes [#302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/302).
- Fixed an edge case in the `driver` that could lead to memory leaks. This happened when Command Logs updated from previously run tests. Normally, in headless mode, we automatically remove references to purge memory after each test, but when logs were updated after this, their references were merged back in again and held onto forever. If you were seeing long Cypress runs die or eventually halt, this was likely the cause. We did extensive memory regression analysis on Cypress and could not find any more memory leaks. Fixes [#301](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/301).

**Misc:**

- Improved [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) and `cypress ci` headless output. Fixes [#306](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/306).
- Improved performance by preventing `snapshots` from being taken during headless runs.
