## 0.20.0

_Released 09/10/2017_

**Summary:**

- `0.20.0` is our biggest technical release ever. It accounts for more than
  2,000 commits. It's full of breaking changes we wanted to land prior to having
  our public `1.0.0` release.
- You can now
  [install Cypress as a real `npm` module](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress),
  and even `require` it in your node files.
- We rewrote the entire driver (we've all been there) and converted all 2,500+
  tests to be run within Cypress itself.

**CLI Changes:**

- You now use `npm` to manage Cypress versions like every other dev dependency.
- Running `npm install --save-dev cypress` will automatically download the CLI +
  binary.
- There is no longer a separate `cypress install` step, but this command still
  exists if you want to **reinstall** the binary for whatever reason.
- No need to use `cypress-cli` anymore to manage Cypress versions. **You will
  need to uninstall the `cypress-cli` by running
  `npm uninstall -g cypress-cli`**.
- The [`cypress` module can be `required`](/guides/guides/module-api) in your
  own node projects to programmatically control Cypress the same way you would
  from the command line.
- We've updated the installation experience to account for running locally and
  in CI so it doesn't generate a ton of logs in `stdout`.
- The `CYPRESS_VERSION` environment variable is gone because now the version of
  the binary is controlled by the npm module version. If for some reason you
  want to download the binary of a different version you can use the new
  `CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION` environment variable - but you'll get a warning
  message when the versions don't match.
- If you install cypress globally using `npm install -g cypress` we will warn
  you that you should check this in as a `devDependency` but Cypress will
  continue to work in "global mode".
- Cypress now verifies it can run on your system prior to actually running.
  It'll do this for each new version the first time you try to use it. Errors it
  receives from attempting to run will bubble up nicely, so you'll get output
  for things like
  [missing linux dependencies](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Dependencies)
  instead of absolutely _nothing_ like before.
- We have better error handling and messaging around Xvfb failures.
- There is a new [`--browser` option](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run)
  that lets you change the browser that runs from the command line. This works
  the same way as changing the browser in the GUI, with the exception that any
  browser other than the default `electron` browser will **not** record a video.
  This is solvable but requires more work.
- Whenever you encounter errors in the CLI we'll output helpful debugging
  information at the bottom of each error.
- You can use the new environment variable
  [`DEBUG=cypress:cli`](/guides/guides/command-line#Debugging-commands) to see
  debugging output from the CLI.

**Breaking Changes:**

- We've removed the undocumented `cy.chain()` command. You should be able to
  safely remove this from your code. Fixes
  [#456](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/456).
- Updated [Cypress.\_](/api/utilities/_) to use [lodash](https://lodash.com)
  instead of [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org). Fixes
  [#548](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/548).
- If any of an element's parent's overflow is 'hidden', we now calculate if the
  element is outside of the boundaries of that parent element and validate
  visibility assertions accordingly. This may cause some tests that were
  previously passing to now accurately fail. Fixes
  [#410](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/410).
- [`.select()`](/api/commands/select) should now look for the trimmed value
  inside of an `<option></option>`. This may change the content argument
  required to select the option you intended in your
  [`.select()`](/api/commands/select) command. Fixes
  [#175](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/175).
- When passing the option `{ force: true }` to [`.click()`](/api/commands/click)
  and [`.type()`](/api/commands/type), we no longer attempt to scroll the
  element into view. We've also disabled the check that the element is in view
  before clicking or typing. Fixes
  [#553](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/553) and
  [#537](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/537).
- `Cypress.Dom` has been renamed to `Cypress.dom`.
- `Cypress.Log.command` has been renamed to
  [Cypress.log](/api/cypress-api/cypress-log).
- [`chai-jQuery` assertions](/guides/references/assertions#Chai-jQuery) no
  longer change the subject when using `prop`, `attr`, and `css` with the
  **3rd** argument (which acts as equality check). Fixes
  [#605](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/605).
- We now throw when a value other than `cy` is returned from a test or command
  function. Fixes [#463](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/463).
- Returning a promise in a custom command while also invoking cy commands now
  throws. Fixes [#435](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/435).
- [cy.then()](/api/commands/then) will now only pass its subject through when
  its callback function returns `undefined`. Previous it would pass the subject
  on `null` values as well.
- [cy.contains()](/api/commands/contains) can no longer be chained on subjects
  which aren't `window`, `document` or `element`. This brings it into parity
  with the new custom command rules and makes it much less "magical". It
  enforces you to use it in a much clearer way when querying the entire
  document.
- Removed `Cypress.addParentCommand()`, `Cypress.addChildCommand()`, and
  `Cypress.addDualCommand()` in favor of the
  [new custom command interface](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands).

**Features:**

- [`chai-jQuery` assertions](/guides/references/assertions#Chai-jQuery) have
  improved error messaging, and have had their internal double assertions
  removed, and can now be made on raw DOM objects. Fixes
  [#605](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/605).
- [`chai-jQuery` assertions](/guides/references/assertions#Chai-jQuery) now
  throw a nice error message when you're asserting on a non DOM object. Fixes
  [#604](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/604).
- New [.trigger()](/api/commands/trigger) command. Useful for triggering
  arbitrary events. Fixes
  [#406](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/406).
- New [cy.scrollTo()](/api/commands/scrollto) command. Useful for having a
  container scroll to a specific position. Fixes
  [#497](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/497) &
  [#313](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/313).
- New [.scrollIntoView()](/api/commands/scrollintoview) command. Useful for
  scrolling an element into view. Fixes
  [#498](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/498) &
  [#313](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/313) &
  [#519](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/519).
- Input ranges are now more easily testable using the new
  [.trigger()](/api/commands/trigger) command. See our
  [new recipe](/examples/examples/recipes#Form-Interactions) for details on how.
  Fixes [#287](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/287).
- Testing drag and drop is now possible using the new
  [.trigger()](/api/commands/trigger) command. See our
  [new recipe](/examples/examples/recipes#Form-Interactions) for details on how.
  Fixes [#386](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/386).
- Updated [.click()](/api/commands/click) command to accept more position
  arguments. Fixes [#499](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/499).
- Added support to [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) for inputs of type `date`,
  `time`, `month`, and `week`. Fixes
  [#27](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27).
- You can now pass a browser option to
  [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) as
  `--browser <browser name>`. This enables you to run the same set of browsers
  when running from the CLI as when you're running from the GUI. Fixes
  [#462](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/462) and
  [#531](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/531).
- [cypress open](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) no longer opens a
  detached process by default. Instead `cypress open` now accepts a new flag
  `--detached`, which replicates this behavior. Fixes
  [#531](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/531).
- We have all new [docker examples](/examples/examples/docker) you can check
  out.
- The [`cypress` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress) now checks
  the currently installed version on `install` and
  [run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) and does not re-install Cypress
  if it is already installed. Fixes
  [#396](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/396).
- We've added a new [Cypress.Commands](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands)
  interface to handle adding your own custom commands. Fixes
  [#436](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/436).
- You can now overwrite existing commands with
  [Cypress.Commands.overwrite](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands).
- We removed an artificial delay that was being set in between commands. This
  means test commands now run faster.
- You can now
  [disable Cypress global exception handlers](/api/events/catalog-of-events) for
  your application. Fixes
  [#254](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/254)
- Uncaught errors appearing in your spec files or support files are now properly
  caught, have the right exit code, and display correctly. Fixes
  [#345](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/345)
- Cypress will now scroll past multiple elements that cover up an element to be
  interacted with. It also now factors in elements with `position: sticky`.
  Fixes [#571](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/571) and
  [#565](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/565).
- Cypress now scrolls all parent containers (not just `window`) when attempting
  to
  [check an element's actionability](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Actionability).
  Fixes [#569](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/569).
- Using
  [Chai.js's `assert` interface](/guides/references/assertions#TDD-Assertions)
  now works correctly in your specs.
- Screenshots are now taken during each runnable that fails. Errors in tests
  will happen there. Errors in hooks will also happen there. Previously a
  screenshot would only happen after everything (including hooks) ran. Fixes
  [#394](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/394)
- [cy.screenshot()](/api/commands/screenshot) now synchronizes its state with
  the reporter. This means you should see error messages (on the left side) on
  automatic screenshot errors.
- Using mocha's async `done` callback now works properly.
- You can now programmatically
  [intercept and potentially turn off uncaught application errors](/api/events/catalog-of-events)
  from failing your tests.
- You can now programmatically control whether you accept or cancel
  [window.confirm()](/api/events/catalog-of-events) calls from your application.

**Dependencies:**

- Updated [Cypress.Promise](/api/utilities/promise) (which is Bluebird) from
  version `2.9.25` to `3.5.0`
- Updated [chai](/guides/references/bundled-tools#Chai) from version `1.9.2` to
  `3.5.0`
- Updated [sinon](/guides/references/bundled-tools#Sinon) from version `1.x` to
  `3.2.0`
- Updated [jQuery](/api/utilities/$) from version `2.1.4` to `2.2.4`.
- Removed [chai-jQuery](/guides/references/bundled-tools#Chai-jQuery) and
  rewrote it from scratch.

**Deprecations:**

- The [`cypress-cli` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-cli) has
  been deprecated. Fixes
  [#316](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/316).
- The interface for writing custom commands has been deprecated.
  [Please read our docs on the new custom commands interface](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands).
  Fixes [#436](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/436) and
  [#465](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/465).
- There are no more global, in-app updates. Versioning should be primarily
  [controlled via `npm`](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) like every
  other package / dependency in your project. For users not using `npm` you can
  manually download new versions of Cypress when they're released.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed busted internal timers that caused random timeouts, proxy errors,
  incorrect delays, and long pauses when loading the GUI. Fixes
  [#572](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/572).
- [cy.route()](/api/commands/route) now matches requests opened with lowercase
  methods. Fixes [#607](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/607).
- Fixed regression where multiple uses of [`cy.server()`](/api/commands/server)
  in a `before` hook was throwing an error. Fixes
  [#80](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/80) and
  [#510](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/510) and
  [#595](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/595).
- When editing `cypress.json` file, the dead browser page no longer appears.
  Fixes [#492](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/492).
- [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) should now work on inputs regardless of
  capitalization of `type` attribute. Fixes
  [#550](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/550).
- Fixed issues where [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) was not appending text
  properly. Fixes [#503](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/503) and
  [#568](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/568).
- Fixed issue where [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) with `type="email"` inputs
  were throwing an error. Fixes
  [#504](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/504).
- Fixed issue where using [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) on an input with a
  `type` defined in uppercase (`input type="TEXT"`) would throw an error and not
  type. Fixes [#550](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/550).
- Fixed issue with [.clear()](/api/commands/clear) and `type="number"` inputs.
  Fixes [#490](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/490).
- Fixed issue where [`cy.exec()`](/api/commands/exec) was failing when running
  Cypress in docker. Fixes
  [#517](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/517).
- Cypress CLI no longer requires `git` to install. Fixes
  [#124](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/124)
- Improved the reporter's responsive design so controls still show at narrower
  widths. Fixes [#544](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/544).
- Commands text will no long cut off into ellipses when the Command Log is set
  to a wider width. Fixes
  [#528](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/528).
- Fixed issue where setting `fixturesFolder` to `false` would throw an error.
  Fixes [#450](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/450).
- Fixed issue where Cypress hanged due to Xvfb permissions. More intuitive
  output is given during install failures. Fixes
  [#330](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/330).
- [The checks used to determine an element's actionability](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Actionability)
  are now run synchronously. This solves some circumstances where the element
  could have moved or otherwise change between the checks. Fixes
  [#570](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/570).
- Fixed issue where clipped elements with `overflow-y: hidden` were falsely
  passing as "visible". Fixes
  [#563](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/563).
- When using [`.select()`](/api/commands/select) on a select with multiple
  options with the same value, we now properly set `selectedIndex` and
  `selectedOptions` on the `select`. Fixes
  [#554](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/554).
- Fixed issue where changing any spec file (renaming, adding, deleting) would
  remove the highlighted styling of the currently active spec file in the Test
  Runner. Fixes [#547](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/547).
- We now get the absolute paths of styles to use when displaying snapshots. This
  will fix situations where some stylesheets were improperly referenced during
  the snapshot, so did not display styles correctly. Fixes
  [#525](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/525).
- Fixed issue where commands would retry and potentially exceed their timeout
  values during page transitions. Fixes
  [#594](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/594)
- Fixed issue where server routes were lost after page load if not initiated by
  a [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) command. Fixes
  [#177](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/177)
- Using mocha's `done` callback now works correctly. We've improved mocha's
  handling of uncaught exceptions and properly associate them to test failures.
- [cy.viewport()](/api/commands/viewport) is now synchronized with the UI so
  that it does not resolve until the DOM has re-rendered using the dimensions.
- "outer assertions" now are correctly retried by previous commands. Fixes
  [#543](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/543).
- The example_spec from the
  [kitchen-sink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink) will
  never accidentally be seeded when running
  [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) on a brand new project.

**Misc:**

- We now display a warning in the console when returning a promise from a test
  and also invoking a Promise or cy commands. Fixes
  [#464](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/464).
- Reduced the number of internal Cypress network requests in the "Network Panel"
  of Dev Tools. Fixes [#606](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/606).
- We've moved our entire codebase into one into a private "Monorepo". This is in
  anticipation for going open source (making the GitHub repo public) and should
  make it easier for everyone to contribute to our code. Fixes
  [#256](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/256).
- When element's are not visible due to being covered by another element, the
  error message now says what element is covering what element.
  [#611](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/611)
- Improved the calculations to calculate an elements visibility. Additionally
  updated error messages to be clearer whenever an element isn't considered
  visible. Fixes [#613](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/613)
- The "Can't start server" error displayed in the Desktop-GUI no longer prevents
  you from interacting in the Desktop App. It now displays as a warning. Fixes
  [#407](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/407).
- [`cy.focused()`](/api/commands/focused) now automatically retries until the
  element exists in the DOM. This makes it behave the same as
  [cy.get()](/api/commands/get) Fixes
  [#564](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/564) and
  [#409](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/409).
- We now support per-project `state.json`. Fixes
  [#512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/512).
- We can now handle multiple projects per server. Fixes
  [#512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/512).
- The Test Runner can now have projects added by being 'dragged' in. Fixes .
- The Test Runner update window now has messaging about `package.json`
  versioning. Fixes [#513](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/513).
- The Test Runner now accounts for cypress being installed per project as npm
  module. Fixes [#500](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/500) and
  [#514](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/514).
- [cypress install](/guides/guides/command-line) `-d` option. Fixes
  [#389](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/389).
- Exposing Cypress Binary should no longer be necessary when cypress is locally
  installed. Fixes [#379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/379).
- Added an 'App Data' option in the Desktop App that displays app data. Fixes
  [#475](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/475).
- When [`cy.spy()`](/api/commands/spy) or [`cy.stub()`](/api/commands/stub) are
  never called, the error now displays a clearer, grammatically correct error.
  Fixes [#520](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/520).
- Detection of installed browsers has been improved. Fixes
  [#511](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/511).
- When commands are clicked on and logged into the console from the Command Log,
  they now display their 'yield' instead of 'return', since they really yield
  instead of return. [#612](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/612)
- The build process of the driver has been modernized. Fixes
  [#429](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/429).
- XHR's from your application are no longer forcefully aborted between tests.
- Better error handling when running commands outside of a test.
- URL changes from navigation events or hashchanges now display more accurately.
- [cy.go()](/api/commands/go) now snapshots before and after the navigation
  event.
- Page load events no longer forcibly `null` out the current subject. This was
  very unexpected and difficult to debug. Now stale elements or other objects
  from previous pages are yielded to you.
- Using an array of the same alias in a [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait) now
  yields you those XHR's in the order they were requested. Previously it was
  based on when the responses were returned.
- Returning `null` from a [.then()](/api/commands/then) will now change the
  subject to that. Previously returning `null` would not cause subject changes.
- We now no longer remove spies, stubs, or routes at the end of the very last
  test. This enables you to continue to manually use your app and have Cypress
  continue to instrument it.
- Updated a few things to more aggressively cause GC.
- Onboarding dialogs will never show up again once they are dismissed. Fixes
  [#522](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/522).
- `window.alert()` and `window.confirm()` now generate a page event in the
  Command Log (including the message).
- [`cy.spy()`](/api/commands/spy) and [`cy.stub()`](/api/commands/stub) now have
  a `.log(bool)` method to disable their calls from generating a Command Log.
  Useful when your spies or stubs are called an excessive number of times.
- Improved command subject validation error messages.
- Improved the element detachment error messages (when you try to interact with
  an element that's become stale / detached from the document).
- We finally have _partial_ iframe support. You can at least now
  [cy.wrap()](/api/commands/wrap) iframe elements and interact with them using
  Cypress commands. More work needs to be done to "switch into" and back "out
  of" iframes. But we're getting there.
- Scaffolding new projects no longer generates a `default.js` file.
- Scaffolded `index.js` and `commands.js` have had their content updated to
  point to the custom commands API.
- You can now call [.focus()](/api/commands/focus) and
  [.blur()](/api/commands/blur) on [cy.window()](/api/commands/window).
- The `CYPRESS_DEBUG` env option has been removed in favor of the `debug` module
  and [`DEBUG=cypress:*`](/guides/guides/command-line#Debugging-commands) usage.
- Attempting to run [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) on a
  project without a `cypress.json` now errors instead of scaffolding and running
  the kitchen sink.
