## 0.17.6

_Released 10/04/2016_

**Features:**

- Snapshots will now be _pinned_ when clicking on a command in the Command Log. This enables you to inspect the state of the DOM when the snapshot was taken. We've given you a new series of controls for turning off the element highlighting and hitboxes. Additionally we've given you the ability to manually click through each named snapshot when there are multiple states (like before and after). Fixes [#247](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/247).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression where tests that failed outside of a hook would incorrectly indicate themselves as a `before each` hook. In addition, in the default `spec`, reporter will now display the test name when a hook was the source of failure. Fixes [#253](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/253).
- Fixed a deployment bug in the `core-desktop-gui`.
- We now prevent [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) from accidentally snapshotting twice.

**Misc:**

- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) and [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) now correctly send `User-Agent` headers based on the current open browsing session. Fixes [#230](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/230).
