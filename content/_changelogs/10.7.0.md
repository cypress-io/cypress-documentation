## 10.7.0

_Released 8/30/2022_

**Features:**

- Re-introduces the experimental
  [Cypress Studio feature](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/cypress-studio).
  Cypress Studio provides a visual way to generate tests within Cypress by
  recording interactions against the application under test. Cypress Studio is
  available only in end-to-end tests, and must be enabled via the
  `e2e.experimentalStudio` flag. For more details, read
  [our blog post](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2022/08/30/how-to-use-studio-in-cypress-10-7).
  Addresses [#23461](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23461).
- Adds [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) component testing support. This feature is
  being released as an Alpha, meaning there may be breaking changes in future
  Cypress releases. Addresses
  [#23037](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23037).
- The "Latest Runs" and "Average Duration" columns in the specs list now provide
  actions when hovered over to assist with the process of connecting the project
  to the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses
  [#22932](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22932).
- Informational banners were added to display instructions to assist with
  connecting projects to the Cypress Dashboard and recording a first test run.
  Users who don't plan to use the Cypress Dashboard can dismiss the banners to
  prevent seeing them in the future. Addresses
  [#22933](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22933),
  [#22934](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22934),
  [#22798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22798), and
  [#22935](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22935).
- Vue.js projects with a custom spec pattern configuration can now use the
  "Create Spec from Component" capability introduced in v10.5.0. Addresses
  [#23071](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23071).
- Angular component testing projects can provide a custom configuration to the
  Webpack dev server using the
  [`projectConfig`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/angular/overview#Options-API)
  key. This enables support for projects that don't adhere to Angular CLI
  conventions. Addresses
  [#23161](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23161).
- The Cypress `clock` can now be set to a new time using the `setSystemTime`
  function. Addresses
  [#15424](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15424).

**Performance:**

- The `cy.session()` command's behavior has been enhanced to no longer clear the
  dom after a validation function runs. This means a `cy.visit()` command is no
  longer required after running `cy.session()` when a validation function is
  used. Addresses [#22368](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22368).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where Cypress could crash if a websocket upgrade request was
  made over HTTPS. Fixes
  [#22217](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22217).
- Fixed an issue where filtering with the `--spec` CLI flag in run mode option
  would not find any specs if the project was located at the root directory of a
  file system. Fixes
  [#23380](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23380).
- Fixed an issue where projects using Angular `v14.2.0` and above would be
  unable to run component tests. Fixes
  [#23585](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23585).
- Fixed an issue where snapshots performed in XHR requests could reflect the
  primary domain instead of current domain. Fixes
  [#21496](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21496).
- An update was made to correctly track Github Actions retries in the Cypress
  Dashboard. Previously retries data was not being recorded. Addressed in
  [#23445](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23445).
- Fixed an issue where an internal TypeScript type was exposed globally. Fixes
  [#23333](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23333).
- Fixed an issue where an incomplete
  [`component.devServer`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#devServer)
  configuration would cause the specs list to not display in the Cypress App
  when running Component Tests in open mode. Fixes
  [#23486](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23486).

**Miscellaneous:**

- Display a default icon in the browser selection menu for browsers without
  bundled icons. Fixes
  [#21766](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21766).
