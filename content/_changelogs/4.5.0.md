## 4.5.0

*Released 4/28/2020*

**Features:**

- Cypress now supports the execution of component tests using framework-specific adaptors when setting the [experimentalComponentTesting](/guides/references/configuration#Experiments) configuration option to `true`.  For more details see the [@cypress/react](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/master/npm/react) and [@cypress/vue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/master/npm/vue) repos. Addresses [#5922](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5922) and [#6968](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6968).

**Bugfixes:**

- [Custom Mocha reporters](/guides/tooling/reporters) will now correctly use the version of Mocha bundled with Cypress. Fixes [#3537](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3537) and [#6984](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6984).
- We better account for word boundaries in application scripts when `modifyObstructiveCode` is `true`. Fixes [#7138](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7138).
- Fixed an issue where iterators in TypeScript were not properly transpiled. Fixes [#7098](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7098).

**Misc:**

- The update window in the Test Runner now encourages yarn users to `yarn upgrade` Cypress instead of `yarn add` to help prevent installing 2 versions of Cypress when using yarn workspaces. Addressed in [#7101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7101).
- We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses [#2690](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2690) in [#7031](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7031) and [#7097](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7097).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` from `8.2.0` to `8.2.3`. Addressed in [#7079](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7079).
