## 0.5.9

_Released 04/26/2015_

**Features:**

- Added [`.spread()`](/api/commands/spread) method which spreads an array as
  individual arguments to a callback function,like
  [`.then()`](/api/commands/then).
- During an update Cypress will now display the updating message in the same
  coordinates as when the app was open by clicking the tray icon.
- After an update Cypress will now open back up and show itself in these same
  coordinates.
- [`cy.wait()`](/api/commands/wait) can now accept an array of route aliases
  which will wait until all have completed. This array of resolved XHRs will
  become the next subject.
- Each time an alias in used with a [`cy.wait()`](/api/commands/wait), Cypress
  will not resolve until the Nth request matching the outing alias responds.
  Fixes [#4](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4).
- [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get) has been upgraded to accept a routing alias.
  By default it will yield the last matched request, but also supports special
  alias properties which return a different request or potentially an array of
  requests.
