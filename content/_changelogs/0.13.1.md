## 0.13.1

_Released 12/11/2015_

**Notes:**

- We are aware of issues running in CI with Linux builds, and are working through those issues.

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent headless / CI from throwing errors on `history.pushState` and `history.replaceState`.
- Prevent edge case where `aliasing` in the Command Log was aliasing the wrong command
- Prevent XHR's from throwing errors on `arraybuffer` content. Properly set `xhr.responseBody` for `XML`, `blob`, and `arraybuffer`.
- Headless running is now fixed in OSX. This was due to a bug with app signing + unzipping via the CLI.
