## 0.13.8

_Released 01/24/2016_

**Features:**

- Added [`cy.reload()`](/api/commands/reload) command which does a full page refresh. This is the same as the user hitting the 'Reload' button. Additionally it matches the same argument signature as `window.location.reload`.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed situation where [`cy.viewport()`](/api/commands/viewport) would not restore correctly between tests. Previously this would cause subsequent tests to be issued at the modified `cy.viewport()`. Now viewport is automatically restored to the settings in your `cypress.json` file.

**Misc:**

- Using [`.its()`](/api/commands/its) on a function or [`.invoke()`](/api/commands/invoke) on a property now logs a deprecation warning. In the next major release this will become a full error. It is valuable to make a distinction whether you're operating on a property vs a function, and this change improves overall readability with less confusion.
- Cypress deprecations and warnings are now prefixed with: `Cypress Warning:` to indicate this message is coming from Cypress
