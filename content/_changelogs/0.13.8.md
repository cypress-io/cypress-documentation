## 0.13.8

_Released 01/24/2016_

**Features:**

- Added [`cy.reload()`](/api/commands/reload) command which does a full page
  refresh. This is the same as the user hitting the 'Reload' button.
  Additionally it matches the same argument signature as
  `window.location.reload`.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed situation where [`cy.viewport()`](/api/commands/viewport) would not
  restore correctly between tests. Previously this would cause subsequent tests
  to be issued at the modified `cy.viewport()`. Now viewport is automatically
  restored to the settings in your `cypress.json` file.

**Misc:**

- Using [`.its()`](/api/commands/its) on a function or
  [`.invoke()`](/api/commands/invoke) on a property now logs a deprecation
  warning. In the next major release this will become a full error. It is
  valuable to make a distinction whether you're operating on a property vs a
  function, and this change improves overall readability with less confusion.
- Cypress deprecations and warnings are now prefixed with: `Cypress Warning:` to
  indicate this message is coming from Cypress
