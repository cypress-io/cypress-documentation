  Addressed in [#17317](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17317).

**Performance:**

- We addressed an issue that increased CPU usage during video recording in
  Chrome 89+/Electron 12+. Fixes
  [#16152](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16152).
- Fixed a regression in [7.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#7-2-0) that would
  cause `cy.visit()` to take longer to fire it's load event in some
  circumstances. Fixes
  [#16671](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16671).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue that could cause intermittent OpenSSL errors when the local CA
  cert cache becomes corrupted. Fixes
  [#8705](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8705).
- Fixed a regression in [7.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#7-2-0) causing the
  menu bar of Cypress to be unclickable in Windows. Fixes
  [#16323](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16323).
- `res.send` of `cy.intercept()` will no longer override JSON-related content
  types. Fixes [#17084](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17084).
- The `times` option of `cy.intercept` now works properly with `req.reply`.
  Fixes [#17139](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17139).
- Fixed a regression in [8.0.0](/guides/references/changelog#8-0-0) where
  Cypress would always warn that `chromeWebSecurity` is set to "false" when it
  wasn't. Fixes [#17614](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17614).
