## 3.1.2

_Released 11/18/2018_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression caused in `3.1.1` where we attempted to set a property on an invalid cookie sent from a server. Fixes [#2724](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2724).
- Fixed Cypress not correctly aborting long running connections (such as server sent events) on proxied requests. Fixes [#2612](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2612).
- Fixed bug where tests were failing due to assertions causing Cypress to accidentally iterate through cross-origin iframes. If you were seeing "random" cross-origin errors, this likely fixes those issues. Fixes [#2784](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2784).
- Fixed incorrectly setting `charCode` and `keyCode` when using [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) on a few different special characters such as `{`. Fixes [#2105](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2105).
- Fixed another regression in `3.1.1` where passing `undefined` to a `setTimeout` caused Cypress to error. Fixes [#2719](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2719).
- Fixed a bug in node core where Cypress would not show up in `Windows` for users on `node >= 11`. Fixes [#2667](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2667).
- Fixed a bug with trashing assets in linux that caused recursive `.Trash` files to show up. We now have opted to actually `rm -rf` the files in linux because trashing is too inconsistent between linux distros. Fixes [#2742](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2742).

**Misc**

- Added type definitions for `Cypress.moment()`. Fixes [#2746](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2746).
- We now display better error messages in the CLI when runs exceed billing limits. Fixes [#1689](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1689).

**Dependency Updates**

- Removed `progress` [#2733](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2733).
