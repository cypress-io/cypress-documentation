## 0.8.1

*Released 06/30/2015*

**Bugfixes:**

- [`.select()`](/api/commands/select) will now fire a `focus` event on the `<select>` even if the window isn't in focus.
- [`.click()`](/api/commands/click) has been upgraded to be more intelligent about firing `focus` events, and now takes into account the previously focused element.
- [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) and [`.clear()`](/api/commands/clear) will not issue `change` events or `focus` events unnecessary when chaining together multiple actions which do not change the element or cause it to lose focus. Fixes [#47](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/47).
