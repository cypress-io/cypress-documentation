## 0.11.1

_Released 09/14/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- Utilizing [`cy.server()`](/api/commands/server) across multiple tests before a [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) now works correctly. As a side effect now Cypress will rebind both the `server` and all `routes` **whenever** the remote window is reloaded (for whatever reason) - even during a test itself. This means you can navigate between pages without ever having to restart the server or routes (they will automatically rebind) when the window loads. Fixes [#59](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/59).

**Misc:**

- Providing a "number-string" as in: `should("have.length", "1")` will no longer throw an error.
- Internal API changes for `$Commands`.
