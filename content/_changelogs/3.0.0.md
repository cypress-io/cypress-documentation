## 3.0.0

_Released 5/29/2018_

**Summary:**

- There is a new [`cy.task()`](/api/commands/task) command that enables you to
  go outside the browser to perform tasks directly in `node`. This will make it
  easy to setup, scaffold, seed, talk to your database, or anything else useful
  on a back end.
- [`cy.screenshot()`](/api/commands/screenshot) has been rewritten from the
  ground up. It now takes a screenshot of **only** the application under test by
  default. It also can take full page screenshots or element only screenshots.
  This is the first step of Cypress Dashboard support for screenshot diffing.
- When running with `cypress run` we now run each spec file in isolation from
  others. We have rewritten our reporter to provide more details and provide a
  summary of the run at the bottom.
- The Dashboard has been upgraded to make it easier to understand the results of
  each spec run. This was done in anticipation of providing you the ability to
  parallelize and load balance your spec files automatically in CI.
- We are now capturing the performance and timings data of every test when using
  `--record` mode and are beginning to offer the first analytics and insights
  into the health of your tests on our Dashboard Service.
- Cypress now caches globally per version which prevents it from being installed
  multiple times across projects.

**Breaking Changes:**

- We now run each spec file in isolation from one another. This _shouldn't_
  technically break anything, but if you have set up your tests in a way that
  requires the state of a previous spec file, this could potentially break your
  tests. This will go a long ways towards reducing problems we were seeing with
  long runs in CI. Fixes
  [#431](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/431),
  [#681](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/681),
  [#1589](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1589),
  [#1539](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1539), and
  [#1692](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1692).
- The environment variable `CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION` has been removed. You should
  use the equivalent environment variable `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` instead.
- The environment variable `CYPRESS_SKIP_BINARY_INSTALL` has been removed. To
  skip the binary install, set `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0`.
- `screenshotOnHeadlessFailure` has been removed as an option in `cypress.json`.
  Instead you can now control this behavior directly with code by setting
  `screenshotOnRunFailure` to `false` within the new
  [Screenshot API](/api/cypress-api/screenshot-api). Fixes
  [#1140](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1140) and
  [#1754](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1754).
- `trashAssetsBeforeHeadlessRuns` has been renamed to `trashAssetsBeforeRuns` in
  our configuration. Fixes
  [#1754](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1754).
- `videoRecording` has been renamed to `video` in our configuration to be
  clearer and prevent confusion about recording to our Dashboard. Fixes
  [#562](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/562).
- Cypress no longer copies screenshots and videos to artifacts for CircleCI.
  Copying artifacts should be left up to the user to
  [handle themselves in their `circle.yml` file](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/).
  Fixes [#1592](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1592).
- The standard output has been redesigned to better visualize spec files running
  in isolation and to be more visually appealing. This may break any specialized
  logic written that expected the standard output to be structured in a specific
  way or contain specific words. Fixes
  [#1588](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1588).
- [`cy.screenshot()`](/api/commands/screenshot) no longer takes a screenshot of
  the runner by default. Instead it will hide the runner, remove application
  scaling and then scroll to take a full page picture of your application.
- `before` and `after` hooks within a
  [support file](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Support-file)
  now run before/after every spec file, instead of only once before/after the
  entire run. [#681](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/681)

**Features:**

- There is a new [`cy.task()`](/api/commands/task) command for executing any
  arbitrary `node` code.
- You can now run multiple specs by passing a glob to the `--spec` argument of
  `cypress run`. Fixes [#263](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/263),
  [#416](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/416) and
  [#681](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/681).
- There is a new [Screenshot API](/api/cypress-api/screenshot-api) and new
  [`cy.screenshot()`](/api/commands/screenshot) options that allow you set
  defaults for how screenshots are captured, whether to scale your app, disable
  timers and animations, or which elements to black out in the screenshot. You
  can also set defaults for whether to automatically take screenshots when there
  are test failures or whether to wait for the Command Log to synchronize before
  taking the screenshot. Fixes
  [#1424](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1424).
- [`cy.screenshot()`](/api/commands/screenshot) can now be chained off of
  commands that yield a DOM element and will only take a screenshot that
  element.
- During install of cypress, the Cypress binary is now downloaded to a global
  cache. This prevents multiple projects from downloading the same Cypress
  version. Fixes [#1300](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1300).
- The seeded `example_spec.js` file has been replaced by an `examples` folder
  with several spec files. This more closely reflects the recommended use of
  Cypress - as smaller groups of tests split among many files that will now be
  run in isolation. The tests were also updated from ES5 to ES6. You can see all
  changes in the
  [`cypress-example-kitchensink` repo](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink)
  Fixes [#1460](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1460).
- Cypress now watches all the `plugins file`'s entire dependency tree to make
  iterating on plugins easier. Fixes
  [#1407](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1407).
- Videos will now be saved locally with a filename named after the associated
  `spec` file that it represents. Fixes
  [#980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/980).
- The Test Runner now displays `skipped` tests differently than `pending` tests.
  [#244](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/244).
- Standard output now displays the number of `skipped` tests within the summary
  output during `cypress run`.
  [#1559](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1559).
- The url to view the run in the Dashboard is now printed to output during
  `cypress run`. [#494](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/494).
- We now print the browser and browser version run in the output during
  `cypress run`. [#833](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/833).
- The build number and url to CI for tests run within [Drone](https://drone.io/)
  are now captured and displayed on the run within the Dashboard.
  [#1709](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1709).

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress no longer crashes when attempting to proxy a WebSocket connection that
  fails. Fixes [#556](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/556).
- Asserting that an attribute equals a falsy value no longer fails when the
  value was falsy. Fixes
  [#831](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/831) and
  [#1491](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1491).
- Snapshots now ignore stylesheets with `media="print"`. Fixes
  [#1568](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1568).
- Fixed issue where the Cypress `window` was being returned instead of AUT's
  `window`. Fixes [#1436](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1436).
- The `close` event now properly fires on `file` when manually closing the
  browser. Fixes [#1560](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1560).
- `cypress.env.json` is now being watched for changes. Fixes
  [#1464](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1464).
- Fixed issue when using TypeScript that caused namespace errors to be thrown.
  Fixes [#1627](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1627).
- Fixed error message on [.type()](/api/commands/type) and
  [.clear()](/api/commands/clear) when typing into non-typeable elements or
  clearing non-clearable elements to accurately list the elements allowed. Fixes
  [#1650](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1650).
- Added Chrome flag `--disable-blink-features=RootLayerScrolling` to prevent the
  application under test from "shaking" in recent versions of Chrome. Fixes
  [#1620](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1620).
- Fixed issue where some TTY characters were not properly formatted in the
  terminal for Windows during `cypress run`. Fixes
  [#1143](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1143) and
  [#1550](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1550).
- Removed an extraneous error display from Electron during `cypress run` about a
  "transparent titlebar" setting. Fixes
  [#1745](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1745).

**Misc:**

- We are now aggressively turning on colors when running in CI. If you're using
  Jenkins and **do not** have an ANSI color plugin installed, you can turn off
  colors with the `NO_COLOR=1` environment variable. Fixes
  [#1747](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1747) and
  [#1748](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1748).
- When running `cypress run --record` on forked PR's, we now detect that the
  Record Key is missing and do not fail the build. We will display a warning,
  but continue running the tests. Fixes
  [#1193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1193).
- Searching in the Test Runner now filters out any non-matching folders. Fixes
  [#1706](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1706).
- Duplicate, subsequent logs in the Command Log are now collapsed and can be
  expanded to view all logs. Fixes
  [#1580](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1580).
- We now throw a descriptive error if an alias using [.as()](/api/commands/as)
  was defined starting with the `@` character.
  [#1643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1643).
- We now pass the `--disable-device-discovery-notifications` flag automatically.
  This should prevent Chromium browser from automatically trying to communicate
  with devices in your network, such as printers, while running tests. Fixes
  [#1600](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1600).
- We now pass any reporter errors along and provide a stack if a custom reporter
  you've provided does not exist. Fixes
  [#1192](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1192).
- You can now pass a normal object to `cypress.open()` or `cypress.run()`
  through the [Module API](/guides/guides/module-api), just as you would from
  the command line. [#1442](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1442).
- Added type definitions for `Cypress.off` and `Cypress.log`. Fixes
  [#1110](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1110) and
  [#1591](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1591).
- Update type definitions for [`cy.screenshot()`](/api/commands/screenshot) to
  reflect new changes to command's options. Fixes
  [#1753](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1753).
- The type definition for [`.filter()`](/api/commands/filter) now correctly
  supports a function argument.
- The type definition for [`.scrollIntoView()`](/api/commands/scrollintoview) no
  longer errors when passed a `duration` option. Fixes
  [#1606](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1606).
- `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variables now print within the `cypress:cli` logs
  when running in `DEBUG` mode. Although using `NODE_OPTIONS` themselves should
  not be used due to [#1676](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1676).
  Fixes [#1673](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1673).
- Cypress will error and exit with status 1 if no specs were found during
  `cypress run`. Fixes
  [#1585](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1585).
- We are now counting and aggregating the stats at the end of test runs
  separately from Mocha. Cypress considers a test to be the `it` and any
  accompanying `hooks` that run before or after a test. Cypress will correctly
  associate failures in those hooks to the test itself. We believe this more
  accurately models and just "makes sense". Fixes
  [#1163](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1163).
- The minimum viewport size has been lowered from `200` pixels to `20` pixels.
  Fixes [#1169](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1169) and
  [#1444](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1444).
- Internal changes to our API structure and communication. Fixes
  [#1170](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1170),
  [#1413](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1413),
  [#1415](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1415).
- We output a much more complete test results object when using cypress as a
  module. Fixes [#1248](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1248).
- Added keywords to Cypress npm package. Fixes
  [#1508](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1508).
- Centered the animating icon in the Test Runner when 'running'. Fixes
  [#1695](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1695).
- We made some changes to internal references of `headed` and `headless` to be
  more specific and instead reference `run mode` and `interactive mode`. Fixes
  [#1140](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1140).
- The test name text is now selectable inside the Command Log. Fixes
  [#1476](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1476).
- Minor improvements to contributing docs and scripts. Fixes
  [#1665](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1665).
- We now collect Semaphore CI params and provide URL's to click into the builds
  from the Dashboard. Fixes
  [#1785](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1785).
- Config overrides coming from the CLI or environment variables are now
  validated the same way as if they've been set in `cypress.json`. Fixes
  [#1783](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1783).
- There is a better / more helpful experience around passing unknown options to
  the CLI. Fixes [#837](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/837).
- Display an empty message when there is no commit information on recorded runs.
