## 3.8.2

*Released 01/10/2020*

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.8.0" changelog-3-8-0 %} on Linux when `unzip` is not installed where the progress of `cypress install` would show up to 200%. Fixes [#5967](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5967).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.7.0" changelog-3-7-0 %} that would prevent [.type()](/api/commands/type) from typing valid characters after invalid characters were typed in `type="number"` inputs. Fixes [#6055](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6055).
- Child elements of an element that uses both `transform` and `height` or `width` are now properly seen as visible during visiblity checks. Addresses [#5974](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5974).
- We now properly check backface visibility when the parents of a target element have the CSS style `transform-style: preserve-3d`. Fixes [#5682](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5682).
- DOM elements with a width or height of 0 and `overflow: hidden` are now properly calculated as invisible during visibility checks. Fixes [#6093](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6093).
- [.should()](/api/commands/should) and [.and()](/api/commands/and) commands with function arguments can now be chained with multiple assertions without throwing an error. Fixes [#4981](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4981).
