## 3.7.0

_Released 11/27/2019_

**Features:**

- Cypress now includes the full list of browsers found and their properties within the Cypress configuration. This means that the `browsers` array is also [editable within plugins by accessing `config.browsers`](/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Customize-available-browsers) via the [Configuration API](/api/plugins/configuration-api). The currently available browsers are also displayed within the [configuration panel](/guides/references/configuration#Resolved-Configuration) under Settings in the Test Runner. Addresses [#5067](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5067).
- Environment variables within GitHub Actions are now detected and passed to the Dashboard in order to display the proper [git information](/guides/continuous-integration/continuous-integration-introduction#Git-information) for recorded runs. Addresses [#5609](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5609).
- [.its()](/api/commands/its) and [.invoke()](/api/commands/invoke) now support a Number for its `propertyName` and `functionName` arguments respectively. Addresses [#5754](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5754).

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where a [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) that changes superdomain would incorrectly clear cookies of other domains. Fixes [#5756](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5756).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where cookies set in a redirect on a [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) or in a `cy.request` with a custom `Domain` that is not a subdomain of the current domain would fail to set. Fixes [#5656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5656).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} which caused [.type()](/api/commands/type) to send duplicate modifier keys. Fixes [#5622](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5622).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.6.1" changelog-3-6-1 %} where [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) with `followRedirect: false` would fail if a `Set-Cookie` header was present in the response. Fixes [#5654](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5654).
- The context of `window` is no longer `undefined` within the application under test when called within a `setTimeout` during strict mode. Fixes [#5707](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5707).
- Cypress now captures the SHA of builds generated through Travis CI during pull requests. This should resolve issues with Cypress status checks sometimes not running within [GitHub Integration](/guides/dashboard/github-integration). Fixes [#5728](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5728).
- Cypress now automatically strips double quotes from [--ci-build-id](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-ci-build-id-lt-id-gt) and [group](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-group-lt-name-gt) flag arguments during `cypress run`. Fixes [#5686](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5686).
- Assertions printed in the [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Command-Log) now correctly identify integers from string integers. Fixes [#25](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25).
- Empty spaces are now accurately reflected in the [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Command-Log) within assertions. Fixes [#1360](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1360).
- Keys printed in the [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Command-Log) when using the `have.all.keys` assertion now correctly display. Fixes [#753](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/753).
- We fixed an issue where Cypress would throw an error when using [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) on a `cleverapp.io` domain. Fixes [#5722](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5722).
- Fixed a bug where fixtures consisting only of `null` would cause an error. Fixes [#472](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/472).
- Fixed a bug where, if the Test Runner child process is killed with a signal and does not exit normally, the npm CLI process would not exit with an error. Fixes [#5808](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5808).

**Misc:**

- Added a new, more specific error message when an item is not visible because it has `position: fixed` and is being overflowed over. Addresses [#1379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1379).
- `cy.visit`s that cause a superdomain change will now result in 2 requests to the origin server. This should not affect tests, as tests will still re-run on a superdomain change. This is a side-effect of the fix for [#5756](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5756).
- The configuration object returned from the plugins file is now validated and will throw a helpful error message when invalid. Addresses [#5712](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5712).
- The [configuration panel](/guides/references/configuration#Resolved-Configuration) under Settings in the Test Runner now has a white background for better readability. Also each configuration option with nested properties is now collapsible. Addressed in [#5068](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/5068).

**Documentation Changes:**

- Updated the [its()](/api/commands/its) and [invoke()](/api/commands/invoke) doc to allow for arguments of type Number for their first argument.
- Documented [how to pass in a custom list of browsers](/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Customize-available-browsers) using `config.browsers`.

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `parse-domain` from `2.0.0` to `2.3.4`. Addressed in [#5726](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/5726).
