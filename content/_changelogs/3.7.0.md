## 3.7.0

_Released 11/27/2019_

**Features:**

- Cypress now includes the full list of browsers found and their properties
  within the Cypress configuration. This means that the `browsers` array is also
  [editable within plugins by accessing `config.browsers`](/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Customize-available-browsers)
  via the [Configuration API](/api/plugins/configuration-api). The currently
  available browsers are also displayed within the
  [configuration panel](/guides/references/configuration#Resolved-Configuration)
  under Settings in the Test Runner. Addresses
  [#5067](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5067).
- Environment variables within GitHub Actions are now detected and passed to the
  Dashboard in order to display the proper
  [git information](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Git-information)
  for recorded runs. Addresses
  [#5609](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5609).
- [.its()](/api/commands/its) and [.invoke()](/api/commands/invoke) now support
  a Number for its `propertyName` and `functionName` arguments respectively.
  Addresses [#5754](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5754).

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where a
  [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) that changes superdomain would incorrectly
  clear cookies of other domains. Fixes
  [#5756](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5756).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where cookies set in a redirect on a
  [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) or in a `cy.request` with a custom `Domain`
  that is not a subdomain of the current domain would fail to set. Fixes
  [#5656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5656).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) which caused
  [.type()](/api/commands/type) to send duplicate modifier keys. Fixes
  [#5622](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5622).
- We fixed a regression in [3.6.1](#3-6-1) where
  [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) with `followRedirect: false` would fail
  if a `Set-Cookie` header was present in the response. Fixes
  [#5654](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5654).
- The context of `window` is no longer `undefined` within the application under
  test when called within a `setTimeout` during strict mode. Fixes
  [#5707](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5707).
- Cypress now captures the SHA of builds generated through Travis CI during pull
  requests. This should resolve issues with Cypress status checks sometimes not
  running within [GitHub Integration](/guides/dashboard/github-integration).
  Fixes [#5728](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5728).
- Cypress now automatically strips double quotes from
  [--ci-build-id](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-ci-build-id-lt-id-gt)
  and [group](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-group-lt-name-gt) flag
  arguments during `cypress run`. Fixes
  [#5686](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5686).
- Assertions printed in the
  [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) now correctly
  identify integers from string integers. Fixes
  [#25](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25).
- Empty spaces are now accurately reflected in the
  [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) within
  assertions. Fixes [#1360](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1360).
- Keys printed in the
  [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) when using the
  `have.all.keys` assertion now correctly display. Fixes
  [#753](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/753).
- We fixed an issue where Cypress would throw an error when using
  [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) on a `cleverapp.io` domain. Fixes
  [#5722](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5722).
- Fixed a bug where fixtures consisting only of `null` would cause an error.
  Fixes [#472](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/472).
- Fixed a bug where, if the Test Runner child process is killed with a signal
  and does not exit normally, the npm CLI process would not exit with an error.
  Fixes [#5808](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5808).

**Misc:**

- Added a new, more specific error message when an item is not visible because
  it has `position: fixed` and is being overflowed over. Addresses
  [#1379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1379).
- `cy.visit`s that cause a superdomain change will now result in 2 requests to
  the origin server. This should not affect tests, as tests will still re-run on
  a superdomain change. This is a side-effect of the fix for
  [#5756](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5756).
- The configuration object returned from the plugins file is now validated and
  will throw a helpful error message when invalid. Addresses
  [#5712](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5712).
- The
  [configuration panel](/guides/references/configuration#Resolved-Configuration)
  under Settings in the Test Runner now has a white background for better
  readability. Also each configuration option with nested properties is now
  collapsible. Addressed in
  [#5068](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/5068).

**Documentation Changes:**

- Updated the [its()](/api/commands/its) and [invoke()](/api/commands/invoke)
  doc to allow for arguments of type Number for their first argument.
- Documented
  [how to pass in a custom list of browsers](/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Customize-available-browsers)
  using `config.browsers`.

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `parse-domain` from `2.0.0` to `2.3.4`. Addressed in
  [#5726](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/5726).
