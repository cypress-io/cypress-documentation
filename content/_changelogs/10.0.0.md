## 10.0.0

_Released 6/1/2022_

**Summary:**

Component testing is now beta! We've also reworked the Cypress app from the
ground up to modernize the interface, streamline workflows and integrate better
into your overall development experience. Read more about 10.0 in
[our blog post](https://cypress.io/blog/2022/06/01/cypress-10-release/).

**Breaking Changes:**

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> Please run
`cypress open` to go through our interactive migration which will guide you in
updating your files and configuration options. Read our
[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains some
breaking changes in more detail.**

- We introduced several breaking changes to the **Cypress configuration file**
  detailed below:
  - Using a `cypress.json` configuration file is no longer supported. Replace
    this configuration file with a `cypress.config.js`, `cypress.config.ts`,
    `cypress.config.cjs` or `cypress.config.mjs` file. This change provides
    better flexibility and extensibility of configuration. An error will be
    thrown if both a `cypress.json` file and `cypress.config.{cjs,js,mjs,ts}`
    file are found. Addressed in
    [#18221](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18221),
    [#18300](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18300),
    [#20554](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20554), and
    [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).
  - A Cypress configuration file is now required and passing the CLI flag
    `--config-file=false` will throw an error. Addressed in
    [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).
  - A default configuration file will no longer be auto-generated by Cypress
    when a configuration file doesn't exist. Instead, you can run `cypress open`
    and set up your project with a specific testing type to have this file
    generated. This allows you to customize the configuration setup by
    testing-type for the language and dependencies leveraged in your project.
  - The configuration file's JSON schema is no longer supported since the
    configuration can no longer be provided via a JSON format.
- Cypress has made several **configuration option changes** including renaming
  options, removing options, and only allowing some options within a specific
  testing type. Please run `cypress open` to have our automated migration update
  these options for you.

  - Many configuration options are now specific to either end-to-end or
    component testing. The types have also been updated to match the new
    structure. Addressed in
    [#20677](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20677).
  - The `baseUrl` and `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` configuration options are
    no longer valid as top-level configuration options and can only be defined
    within the `e2e` configuration. Addressed in
    [#20589](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20589) and
    [#21588](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21588).
  - The `supportFile` and `slowTestThreshold` options are no longer valid as
    top-level configuration options and must now be defined within the `e2e`
    and/or `component` configurations.
  - Previously the `supportFile` option defaulted to `cypress/support/index.js`.
    Now the [`e2e.supportFile`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) option
    defaults to `cypress/support/e2e.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` and the
    [`component.supportFile`](/guides/references/configuration#component) option
    defaults to `cypress/support/component.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`. Addressed in
    [#19776](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19776) and
    [#19364](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19364).
  - The `pluginsFile` option was removed. This option should be replaced with
    the new
    [`setupNodeEvents()`](/guides/references/configuration#setupNodeEvents) and
    [`devServer()`](/guides/references/configuration#devServer) configuration
    options. Addressed in
    [#18798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18798) and
    [#20560](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20560).
  - The `testFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced with the new
    `specPattern` option. Addressed in
    [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319) and
    [#20565](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20565).
  - The `integrationFolder` and `componentFolder` options were removed. These
    options were made obsolete by the new `specPattern` option. Addressed in
    [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).
  - The `ignoreTestFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced with the
    new `excludeSpecPattern` option. Addressed in
    [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).
  - The `experimentalStudio` option was removed with the removal of the
    experimental Cypress Studio feature. If this option is configured in your
    project, a warning message will be displayed. Please leave any feedback
    around Cypress Studio
    [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21561). Addressed
    in [#20515](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20515).

- During `cypress open`, the ability to "Run all specs" and "Run filtered specs"
  has been removed. Please leave feedback around the removal of this feature
  [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21628). Your feedback
  will help us make product decisions around the future of this feature.

- The experimental Cypress Studio feature has been removed. Please leave
  feedback around the removal of this feature
  [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21561). Your feedback
  will help us make product decisions around the future of this feature.
  Addressed in [#20515](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20515).
- You will no longer be able to run your tests during `cypress run` or
  `cypress open` in
  [browser versions that are not supported by Cypress](/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Browser-versions-supported).

- Generated screenshots and videos will still be created inside their respective
  folders (`screenshotsFolder`, `videosFolder`). However, the paths of generated
  files inside those folders will be stripped of any common ancestor paths
  shared between spec files found by the `specPattern` option and may no longer
  be deterministic. Addressed in
  [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).

**Deprecations:**

- The `cypress open-ct` and `cypress run-ct` commands have been deprecated. Use
  `cypress open --component` and `cypress run --component` instead. Addresses
  [#18418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18418).

**Features:**

- Cypress 10 now includes beta support for **component testing**. More features
  around component testing are detailed below:

  - Component testing is now integrated directly into the main app, allowing you
    to choose which testing experience you want upon launching Cypress. See our
    [current support for frameworks and bundlers](/guides/getting-started/component-framework-configuration).
    Addressed in [#21111](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21111).
  - Cypress will now guide you through installing the component testing
    dependencies and project setup necessary to begin component testing in
    Cypress. Previously this required manual setup and referencing the
    documentation.
  - When you use the Cypress app during `cypress open` to configure your project
    for CT testing, a [`cy.mount()`](/api/commands/mount) command will be
    automatically scaffolded for you in a `ct.supportFile`.
  - You can now create an empty component testing spec file from within the
    Cypress app directly and preview the specfile upon creation.
  - The following component testing plugins are now shipped with Cypress to
    enable easy `cy.mount()` implementation. Your local framework dependencies
    found in `node_modules` will be referenced to prevent adding additional
    dependencies or peer-dependencies to your `package.json`. From now on, the
    latest plugin version will be shipped with each Cypress release. See our
    [current support for frameworks and bundlers](/guides/getting-started/component-framework-configuration).
    Addressed in [#20930](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20930).
    - `@cypress/mount-utils@2.0.0`
    - `@cypress/react@6.0.0`
    - `@cypress/vue@4.0.0`
    - `@cypress/vue2@1.0.0`

- We've enhanced how you can set and refresh **configuration** detailed below:

  - Support for `cypress.config.js|ts|cjs|mjs` configuration files was added.
    Addressed in [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).
  - The Cypress app will now refresh when changes are made in the configuration
    file instead of closing the app. Addressed in
    [#21160](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21160).

- We've added several **new configuration options** detailed below:

  - The [`setupNodeEvents()`](/guides/references/configuration#setupNodeEvents)
    option is a new testing type specific configuration option. It must be
    defined within the [`e2e`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or
    [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component) configurations.
    This option allows you to modify your loaded configuration, listen to events
    and register plugins. This option replaces the `pluginsFile` option.
    Addressed in [#18798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18798) and
    [#20560](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20560).

  - The [`devServer`](/guides/references/configuration#devServer) option is a
    new component testing specific option that must be defined within the
    [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component) configuration.
    This option provides a mechanism for starting a component testing dev-server
    when tests are running.

  - The [`specPattern`](guides/references/configuration) option is a new
    testing-type specific configuration option that must be defined within the
    [`e2e`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or
    [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component) configurations.
    This option accepts a glob or an array of globs of the spec files to load.
    This option simplifies the spec discovery by replacing the
    `componentFolder`, `integrationFolder` and `testFiles` options. Addressed in
    [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319),
    [#20565](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20565) and
    [#20853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20853).

    - The [`e2e.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) default
      value for new projects is `cypress/e2e/**.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`. For
      existing projects, please run `cypress open` to have your spec files
      automatically migrated to match this `specPattern`. Addressed in
      [#21193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21193).
    - The [`component.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component)
      default value is `**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`.

  - The `excludeSpecPattern` option is a new testing type specific configuration
    option that must be defined within the
    [`e2e`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or
    [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component) configurations.
    This option accepts a glob or an array of globs which allows you to ignore
    spec files that would otherwise be shown in your list of specs. This option
    replaces the `ignoreTestFiles` option. Addressed in
    [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319),
    [#19980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19980),
    [#20763](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20763),
    [#20853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20853).
    - The [`e2e.excludeSpecPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e)
      default value is the same as the replaced `ignoreTestFiles` glob pattern
      of `*.hot-update.js`.
    - The
      [`component.excludeSpecPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component)
      default value is `['**/__snapshots__/*','**/__image_snapshots__/*']` plus
      the `e2e.specPattern` glob patterns.
    - The `**/node_modules/**` pattern is automatically added to both
      `e2e.excludeSpecPattern` and `component.excludeSpecPattern` and can't be
      overridden. This is consistent with <10.0 behavior.
  - Intelligent Code Completion was added with the `defineConfig()` helper
    function. This enables configuration auto-completion and in-line
    documentation in the configuration file in your IDE. While it's not strictly
    necessary for Cypress to parse your configuration, we recommend wrapping
    your config object with `defineConfig()`. Addressed in
    [#18302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18302).

- We've made some updates to **Cypress API commands** detailed below:

  - Enhancements were made to provide visual indication of nested commands and
    logs. With this change, users are now able to click on log groups to print
    additional log details to the dev tools console.
  - The `.within()` command was updated to provide visual indication of logs and
    commands executed in the `.within` command context. Addresses
    [#20433](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20433).
  - The redundant `cy.session()` log is now removed. Address
    [#7673](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7673) in
    [#21457](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21457).

  - Users can now add custom `cy.hover()` and `cy.mount()` implementation using
    `Cypress.Commands.add()` since we don't provide a default implementation.
    Previously users had to use `Cypress.Command.override()` to provide the
    custom implementation. Addresses
    [#18941](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18941).

- We've made some updates to the **Cypress CLI** detailed below:

  - You can now pass in testing type specific configuration options via the
    `--config` CLI flag without nesting JSON. Addressed in
    [#20127](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20127).

  - New `--e2e` and `--component` CLI flags were added to `cypress run` and
    `cypress open` to allow a user to run or launch Cypress for a specific
    testing-type. If a testing-type specific CLI flag is not provided when
    running `cypress run`, Cypress will run end-to-end tests by default.
  - A warning message is now displayed when `cypress open` is ran with the
    `--browser` CLI flag for a browser that does not exist on the system.
    Addressed in [#18473](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18473).
  - If a testing type and browser flag are passed to `cypress open` when
    launching a specific project, the browser will automatically launch.
    Addressed in [#21538](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21538).

- The `cypress open` experience has been updated to take you through our
  **Launchpad** with many features detailed below:

  - When you launch Cypress via `cypress open` you'll be asked whether you want
    to do end-to-end or component testing and taken through the configuration
    necessary to set up your project. Addressed in
    [#18924](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18924).
  - Having files scaffolded on new projects during end-to-end testing is now opt
    in and not automatic. Addressed in
    [#18924](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18924).

  - When Cypress detects you have a `cypress.json` during `cypress run`, it will
    error and ask you to run `cypress open` to migrate. When Cypress detects you
    have a `cypress.json` during `cypress open`, it will guide you through
    project migration to ensure your project continues to work as expected.
    Addressed in [#18924](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18924).

- After launching the browser, there are several new features in our **App**
  detailed below:

  - The Cypress app has been redesigned so that the Command Log and all
    associated navigation display with a dark background.
  - You can now change specs or the browser within the same window as running
    your tests.
  - Many git details are now shown within your current project in Cypress
    including the current branch and the last commit details of each spec in the
    spec explorer. Addressed in
    [#20648](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20648),
    [#21139](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21139),
    [#21436](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21436) and
    [#20744](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20744)
  - When creating a new spec within Cypress, your project's language is detected
    to provide the correct file extension and the `specPattern` is checked to
    ensure the spec is found by Cypress. After creating the spec, you can
    preview the spec that was generated with the option to immediately run the
    spec or create another spec. Addressed in
    [#21225](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21225),
    [#20567](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20567),
    [#20657](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20657),
    [#20962](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20962).
  - The Settings page has been redesigned to more clearly distinguish between
    settings that are specific to the project, your device, and the Dashboard.

**Bugfixes:**

- An error message is displayed when you add a command using
  `Cypress.Commands.add()` that has the same name as an internal reserved
  Cypress command. Addresses
  [#6146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6146).
- A one pixel, left, vertical border was removed that was incorrectly included
  on screenshot artifacts generated from the `cy.screenshot()` command in
  component tests. Addressed in
  [#21019](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21019).
- A memory leak was fixed during `cypress run` for end-to-end tests launched in
  Chromium and Firefox browsers that reduces the overall time it takes to run a
  set of specs and aligns with how the browser is launched once for all specs in
  component testing. With this change, the `before:browser:launch` node event
  will now properly only fire once per run, instead of firing before each spec.
  Addressed in [#19915](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19915).
- The default webpack configuration's host value was changed from `localhost` to
  `127.0.0.1` to support the Node 17+ changes with how DNS names are resolved.
  Addressed in [#21430](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21430).
- Cypress will throw a detailed error when some plugin versions are no longer
  supported in Cypress 10. Addressed in
  [#21169](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21169)

**Dependencies:**

- Added `@cypress/mount-utils@2.0.0` dependency.
- Added `@cypress/react@6.0.0` dependency.
- Added `@cypress/vue@4.0.0` dependency.
- Added `@cypress/vue2@1.0.0` dependency.

**Misc:**

- The Plugins concept in Cypress still exists with the intent to tap into,
  modify or extend the internal behavior(s) of Cypress. It however is expected
  to be used in conjunction with our new `setupNodesEvents` configuration
  option, which was named to reflect that Plugins leverage Cypress's node
  events.
