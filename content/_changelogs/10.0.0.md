## 10.0.0

_Released TBD_

**Breaking Changes:**

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> Please read our
[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes
in more detail and provides what you need to change in your code to migrate to
Cypress 10.0.**

- We introduced several breaking changes to the Cypress configuration both to
  how the configuration is provided and to the configuration options themselves.
  For the a detailed explanation of these changes, please consult our
  [Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) amd use the 10.0
  migration workflow by running`cypress open` and selecting the project you
  would like to migrate. Breaking changes include:

  <!-- - Terminology Shift
    - A new setupNodeEvents configuration option was introduced to describe that Plugins leveraged node events to tap into, modify or extend the internal behavior of Cypress. The concept of Plugins in Cypress will be carried forward with the understanding they are leveraged within a setup context. -->

  - Cypress Configuration File

    - Using a `cypress.json` configuration file is no longer valid and must be
      replaced with either a `cypress.config.js`, `cypress.config.ts`,
      `cypress.config.cjs` or `cypress.config.mjs` file. This change provides
      better flexibility and extensibility of configuration. With this change,
      If both a `cypress.json` file and `cypress.config.*` file are found or if
      the CLI flag of `-C,--config-file=*.json` is passed, an error will be
      thrown. Addressed in
      [#18221](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18221),
      [#18300](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18300) and
      [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).
    - A Cypress configuration file is now required and passing the CLI flag
      `-C,--config-file=false` will result in an error, where as previously
      Cypress accepted `-C,--config-file=false` to fallback to the Cypress
      default configuration values. By default Cypress will automatically load
      the config file that matches `cypress.config.{cjs,js,mjs,ts}` if the
      `-C,--config-file` CLI flag is not passed. Addressed in
      [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).
    - A default configuration file will no longer be auto-generated by Cypress
    if a configuration file does not exist. Instead, Cypress will take you
    through a Project Setup workflow in `open` mode. This allows you to
    customize the configuration setup by testing-type for the language and
    dependencies leveraged in your project.
    <!-- - [RECOMMENDATION] In 9.4.0 we added Intelligent Code Completion via the `defineConfig()` helper function. We encourage leveraging this helper while migrating your configuration. -->

  - Cypress Configuration Options

    - Cypress has had several configuration changes to clarify which
      configuration options are specific to either e2e or component testing or
      shared between all testing-types. The Migration workflows will handle
      updating these options for you.

      - Changed Options

        - The `supportFile` option is no longer valid as a top-level
          configuration option and is now a testing-type specific option that
          must be defined within the `e2e` and/or `component` configuration.
          Previously the `supportFile` options defaulted to
          `cypress/support/index.js` for both testing types, now the
          [`e2e.supportFile`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) option
          defaults to `cypress/support/e2e.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` and the
          [`component.supportFile`](/guides/references/configuration#component)
          option defaults to `cypress/support/component.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`.
          Addressed in
          [#19776](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19776) and
          [#19364](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19364).

        - The [`baseUrl`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) option option is
          only applicable to E2E testing and is no longer valid as a top-level
          configuration option. Instead, it must be defined within the `e2e`
          configuration.

        - The `slowTestThreshold` option is no longer valid as a top-level
          configuration option and is now a testing-type specific option that
          must be defined within the
          [`e2e`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or
          [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component)
          configuration. The default values for both testing types have not
          changed and are still `10000` ms for E2E testing and `250` ms for
          component testing.

      - New Options

        - The `setupNodeEvents` option is new testing-ype specific configuration
          option. It must be defined within the
          `e2e`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or
          [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component)
          configuration. This option accepts a function which allows you to
          modified your loaded configuration, listen to events and register
          plugins. This option replaced the `pluginsFile` option. Addressed in
          [#18798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18798) and
          [#20560](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20560).

        - The [`devServer`](/guides/references/configuration#devServer) option
          is a new component testing specific configuration option that must be
          defined within the `component` configuration. This option provides a
          mechanism for starting a component testing dev-server when tests are
          running.

        - The `specPattern` option is new testing-type specific configuration
          option that must be defined within the
          [`e2e`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or
          [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component)
          configuration. This option accepts a glob pattern or an Array of globs
          patterns of the spec files to load. This option simplified the spec
          discovery by replacing the`componentFolder`, `integrationFolder` and
          `testFiles` options. Addressed in
          [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).

          - The [`e2e.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e)
            default value is `cypress/e2e/**.cy*{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`. Previously the
            e2e spec files were discovered using the `integrationFolder` and
            `testFile` options, which defaulted to the pattern
            `cypress/integration/*/*.*`.
            - With this change, if you are not a Dashboard user, we are
              suggesting you move you spec files to `cypress/e2e` and namespace
              your spec files with `.cy`.
            - If you are a Dashboard user, if you choose to rename your specs,
              you will **lose** the spec's run history.
            - Note, this change drops support for matching specs with either
              `.coffee` or `.cjsx` extensions.
          - The
            [`component.specPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component)
            default value is `**/*.cy*{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`. Previously the component
            spec files were discovered using the `componentFolder` and
            `testFile` options, which had defaulted to the pattern
            `cypress/component/*/*.*`.

        - The `excludeSpecPattern` option is new testing-type specific
          configuration option that must be defined within the
          [`e2e`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or
          [`component`](/guides/references/configuration#component)
          configuration. This option accepts a glob pattern or an Array of globs
          patterns which allows you to ignore spec files that would otherwise be
          shown in your list of specs. This option replaced the
          `ignoreTestFiles` option. Addressed in
          [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319) and
          [#19980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19980).
          - The [`e2e.excludeSpecPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#e2e)
            default value maps to the replaced `ignoreTestFiles` pattern of
            `*.hot-update.js`.
          - The
            [`component.excludeSpecPattern`](/guides/references/configuration#component)
            default value is `['**/__snapshots__/*','**/__image_snapshots__/*']`
            plus the `e2e.specPattern` patterns. Previously this defaulted to
            the pattern `*.hot-update.js`.
          - The `**/node_modules/**` pattern is automatically added to both
            `e2e.specExcludePattern` and `component.specExcludePattern`, and
            does not need to be specified and it can't be overridden. This is
            consistent with <10.0 behavior.

      - Removed Options
        - The `pluginsFile` option was removed. This option was replaced with
          the new `setupNodeEvents` option. Adding the `pluginsFile` option will
          now result in an error. Addressed in
          [#20560](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18798) and
          [#20560](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20560).
        - The `testFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced with the
          new `specPattern` option. Adding the `testFiles` option will now
          result in an error. Addressed in
          [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319) and
          [#20565](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20565).
        - The `integrationFolder` option was removed. This option was made
          redundant with by the new `specPattern` option. Adding the
          `integrationFolder` option will now result in an error. Addressed in
          [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).
        - The `componentFolder` option was removed. This option was made
          redundant with by the new `specPattern` option. Adding the
          `componentFolder` option will now result in an error. Addressed in
          [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).
        - The `ignoreTestFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced
          with the new `excludeSpecPattern` option. Adding the `ignoreTestFiles`
          option will now result in an error. Addressed in
          [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).
        - The `experimentalStudio` option was removed since the experimental
          "Cypress Studio" has been removed and will be rethought/revisited in a
          later release. <!-- Addressed in [#](). -->

- Cypress Module / CLI

  - The new `--e2e` and `--component` CLI flags were added to the `cypress run`
    and `cypress open` commands to allow a user to run or launch Cypress for a
    specific testing type.
    - If a testing-type CLI flag is not provided when tunning the `cypress open`
      command, Cypress will show the Launchpad to the user so they can select
      the testing type to test. Previously `cypress open` would launch Cypress
      for E2E testing for a specific project.
    - If a testing-type CLI flag is not provided when tunning the `cypress run`
      command, Cypress will continue to run E2E tests by default.
  - The `cypress open-ct` and `cypress run-ct` command have been removed and
    replaced by `cypress open --component` and `cypress run --component`.
    Addresses [#18418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18418).

  - Rough draft: We now ship the following component testing plugins with the
    cypress modules: . We use your local framework dependencies found in
    `node_modules`, so this does not add additional dependencies to the Cypress
    package.json. <-- shouldn't this be listed as peer-dependencies so these are
    available when tests run?The latest plugin version will be shipped with each
    Cypress release. Be sure to check the plugin's minimum dependency version to
    leverage these out-of-the box from the cypress module. If you are using a
    non-compatible version, you can add a custom devServer configuration and
    cy.mount() command to test in Cypress.
    [#20930](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20930)

- Cypress Commands

  - Updates have been made to allow users to add `cy.hover()` and `cy.mount()`
    customs commands using `Cypress.Commands.add()` since we do not provide a
    default implementation but suggest adding a custom command to provide this
    functionality. Previously users had to use `Cypress.Command.override()` to
    provide the custom command. Addresses
    [#18941](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18941).

- Removed Cypress Studio support.

**Deprecations:**

**Features:**

- Added support for `cypress.config.cjs` and `cypress.config.mjs` configuration
  files. Addressed in
  [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).
- Enhanced `.within()` to provide visual indication of nested commands and logs.
  Addresses [#20433](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20433).

- Intelligent Code Completion was added with the `defineConfig()` helper
  function. This enables configuration auto-completion and in-line documentation
  in the configuration file while minimizing boilerplate configuration values.
  While it's not strictly necessary for Cypress to parse your configuration, we
  recommend wrapping your config object with `defineConfig()`. Addressed in
  [#18302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18302).

**Bugfixes:**

- Improvements were made to the error message in the scenario when a user would
  attempting to add a new command using `Cypress.Commands.add()` that has the
  same name as an internal function reserved by Cypress. The improved error
  message explains why the command name must be changed where previously a Type
  Error was thrown without relevant information. Addresses
  [#6146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6146).

**Dependencies:**

- Terminology

  - The Cypress App has been renamed from "Test Runner" to "Cypress App". When
    talking about test runners, we can say that the Cypress App is a test
    runner, but we should not refer to it as the test runner.

- The “Run all specs” and “Run filtered specs” functionality have been removed.

- The experimental “Cypress Studio” functionality has been removed and will be
  rethought/revisited in a later release. A warning will be displayed in both
  `open` and `run` mode to warn the user uses this flag is set to inform them
  that this has been removed so that they don't think it's a working feature
  that is broken. https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20515

## Cypress Configuration

- We introduced several breaking changes to the Cypress configuration both the
  how the configuration is provided and to the configuration options themselves.
  For the a detailed explanation of these changes, please consult the migration
  guide and/or use the 10.0 migration workflow by running `cypress open` and
  selecting the project you would like to migrate. Breaking changes include:

  - The `cypress.json` configuration file is no longer valid and must be
    replaced with either a `cypress.config.js`, `cypress.config.ts`,
    `cypress.config.cjs` or `cypress.config.mjs` file. If both a `cypress.json`
    file and `cypress.config.*` file is found, or if multiple flavors of
    `cypres.config.*` are found, an error will be thrown. This change provide
    better flexibility and extensibility of configuration.
  - A Cypress configuration file is now required, where as previously Cypress
    accepted the CLI flag of `-C,--config-file=false` to fallback to the Cypress
    default configuration values. By default Cypress will automatically load the
    config file that matches `cypress.config.{cjs,js,mjs,ts}` if a the
    `-C,--config-file` CLI flag is not passed. With this change, if a
    configuration file is not found, in `run` mode, Cypress will fail and in
    `open` mode, Cypress will take you through the Project Setup workflow.

  - Running Cypress in a new, non-configured project will no longer
    automatically scaffolled the a defaul ct configuration file

- `cypress.json` will no longer be auto-generated by Cypress if no config file
  exists.
- R The user will be able to choose which of the `cypress.config.js` or
  `cypress.config.ts` files is auto-generated by Cypress via a setup wizard when
  <!-- Cypress detects that no config file exists.
- ~R Having both `cypress.config.js` and `cypress.config.ts` files will result
  in an error when Cypress loads.~ -->
- R CoffeeScript config files (eg. `cypress.config.coffee`) are not supported
- R T he user will be able to use `--config-file` command line flag or the
`configFile` module API option to specify a `.js` or `.ts` file, JSON config
files are no longer supported.
<!-- - R Cypress now requires a config file, so specifying `--config-file false` on the
  command line or a `configFile` value of `false` in the module API is no longer
  valid. -->

  - Updates have been made to the Cypress Application launched in either open
    mode or global mode.

    - Previously, you would open Cypress with a specific testing type specified
      with a CLI flag (e2e by default) and then you would be shown the list of
      specs available to run for that project and testing type. You would then
      select a spec and it would launch in the specified browser to run the
      tests found in that spec. You would have to close the browser and navigate
      back to the Cypress Application to change specs or would have to close
      Cypress to change between e2e testing and component testing. This was a
      fragmented experience.
    - Now, when you can launch Cypress in open mode you will be asked which
      testing type you would like to test, E2E or component testing. Once you
      select the testing type, you select the browser you want to test in and
      the browser will open to show the list of specs available to run for that
      project and testing type. Switching between specs happened within the
      browser, giving a better development experience all in one place. To
      switch between specs, instead of closing and re-launching Cypress, you can
      simply switch testing types and re-launch the browser to test in.

  - Project Setup Flows

    - Cypress now provides project step flows for both e2e and ct testing to
      provide quick Cypress setup. These flows replace the boilerplate,
      auto-scaffolding that occurred in <10.0 when a Cypress configuration file
      was not detected in the project root. These flow share information on the
      files generated by Cypress why they are important and gives users the
      opportunities to select the setup configuration that fit their project's
      needs.

  - Project Migration

    - Cypress 10.0 had quite a few configuration changes to clarify what
      configurations were leveraged by each testing type. To assist with
      updating to Cypress 10.0, when Cypress detected you have a cypress.json
      file in your project, it will guide you through the project migration flow
      to ensure your project works as expected with the new and changed
      configuration options. There is a migration flow for both e2e testing and
      for component testing and you will be guided through each separately, if
      previously configured, to ensure

- Browser View:

  - The spec list shown in Cypress open mode now shows the github history next
    to the spec to provide details on when and who last touched a spec file.

## User Facing - New Information

[#21432](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21432)

- automatically detect and add bundler config to cypress.config.js when
  configuring component testing.
- attempt to detect {webpack|vite}.config.js in common locations if required
  (eg, when using a library w/o an adapter like CRA, Next.js, etc)
- if we find the config, automatically add it to the generated cypress.config.js
- if not, add a comment asking the user to add it

[#21452](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21452) Display full browser
info on project settings instead of just the name.

[#21430](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21430) Updated the default
webpack configuration's host value from `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` to support
Node 17+ usage since Node updated how DNS names are resolved.

[#21458](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21458) Summary: Support
migrating multiple projects in global mode.

[#21411](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21411) ---> equal to 9.x
behavior? scaffold the a component spec in cypress/component/\*.js by default

[#21422](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21422) ---> equal to 9.x
behavior? Provide instruction on how to record your first run to the Cypress
Dashboard

[#21370](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21370)---> equal to 9.x
behavior? The runs tab will refresh with the latest runs & updates to any
"running" rows in an interval, currently every 15 seconds.

[#21293](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21293) ---> equal to 9.x
behavior? Hide the matches count on the spec creation modal

## User Facing - Fixes for New Features 10.0 Introduces

[#21467](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21467)

- Updates terminal error for non migrated projects to have the correct value of
  possible config files and includes a link to the migration guide.
- Also, updated all cypress.config.{ts|js} for cypress.config.{js,ts,mjs,cjs}

Browser Launch

- When running test, the logic has been enhanced to

Launchpad - Testing Types Page

- [#21111](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21111) add beta labels to
  component testing cared

Launchpad - Load Config

- [#21176](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21176)- fix: When the app
  is in an error state, and the user clicks "Try again" and the result is
  another error, the new error is now displayed instead of getting stuck in the
  initialization state.
- [#21160](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21160) - update app /
  resolved config when user changes config in their configuration file.

- [#20853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20853) The config errors
  now contain the exact testing type user should place the specPattern and
  excludeSpecPattern in dpeending on which testing type was being loaded

Dashboard Runs Page [#21337](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21337) -
clear remote data when user logs out
[#21282](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21282) - record icon
[#21154](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21154) - verify user is a
member of the Cypress project before showing Dashboard data

Migration

- [#21344](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21344) add custom
  specPattern if user opt out renaming spec ext
- [#21442](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21442) When the plugins
  file for migration, had an incorrect path or an error, we were not handling
  correctly the errors and it was affecting the main process, with this change
  we handle the child process error without affecting the Cypress process
- [#21467](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21467) (run mode?) Updates
  terminal error for non migrated projects to have the correct value of possible
  config files and includes a link to the migration guide.

- [#21255](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21255) Gracefully fail
  with error when Cypress 10+ is launched in global mode and the user tried to
  open and migrating a project with Cypress 9 installed with the project's
  package.json. ((It's possible to launch Cypress 10 in global mode with the
  --global flag. If the user then attempts to migrate a Cypress 9 project using
  the globally launched Cypress 10, we will generate Cypress 10 APIs
  (cypress.config.js, etc). If they later try to launch their Cypress 9 project,
  using it's locally installed Cypress 9, it will fail, since it will be
  expecting things like cypress.json, not cypress.config.js.))
- [#21193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21193)Do not migrate the
  user's spec to use `.cy.` pre-extension if the project has a Cypress Dashboard
  projectId in the config and add a custom specPattern in the config file. The
  reason behind this change is to keep the spec history on the cloud.

- [#21195](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21195) Correctly
  migrations custom testFiles and componentFolder to specPattern API, even if
  project has no specs. Also improves indentation, since we don't bundle
  prettier anymore, by using @babel/generator instead, which is smaller
  bundlephobia.

- [21054](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21054) When we were
  migrating the specs, we were removing the non spec files on the integration
  folder. So, after moving the spec files, we want to copy, the remaining files
  on the integration folder into the e2e folder

  selecting not to rename the spec (only the folder) we were still highlighting
  the extension o the spec as it was gonna be changed
