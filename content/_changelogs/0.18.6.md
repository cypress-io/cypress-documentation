## 0.18.6

*Released 01/29/2017*

**Features:**

- We now launch Cypress tests directly to the `baseUrl` to avoid an initial page refresh when encountering the first [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) command. This should help tests run faster. Fixes [#382](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/382).

**Bugfixes:**

- Uninstalling the last used browser no longer causes the Test Runner to error and hang. Fixes [#371](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/371).
- Fixed issue where `stdout` would not be displayed on a completed `cypress ci` run. Fixes [#398](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/398).
- Fixed a longstanding issue in Cypress where logging in from another computer would kill the session on all other computers, and prevent you from accessing `cypress get:key` (amongst other things). Fixes [#400](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/400).

**Misc:**

- We now validate all of the configuration options set in `cypress.json` to ensure it has valid types. Fixes [#399](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/399).
- We now validate that `baseUrl` is accessible **prior** to running tests. This prevents a common situation where you may forget to boot your web server and have instantly failing tests. Fixes [#383](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/383).
- We now show the entire scaffolded tree of files when adding a brand new project. Fixes [#401](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/401).
- We display errors coming from `babel` with more helpful information now.
- Changed the [Test Runner](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/packages/desktop-gui) to use `JWT` for authorization. **You will have to log in again**.
