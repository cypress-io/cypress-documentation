## 5.6.0

_Released 11/09/2020_

**Features:**

- You can now dynamically add aliases for requests intercepted via
  [`cy.route2()`](http). [See an example](http#Aliasing-individual-requests).
  Addresses [#387](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/387).
- You can now run all integration specs or all component specs separately (or a
  filtered list of specs) by clicking the appropriate button in the Test Runner
  in the _Tests_ tab. Addresses
  [#8203](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8203).
- Added a new modifier syntax to [cy.type()](/api/commands/type). You can now
  type shortcuts like `{ctrl+z}`. Addressed in
  [#5694](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5694).
- We now show a modal with release notes when available when there is a new
  version of Cypress. Addressed in
  [#9006](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9006).
- In the Test Runner's _Settings_ and _Runs_ tab you can now quickly copy the
  project id configuration and record key using a copy to clipboard icon.
  Addresses [#9002](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9002).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression introduced in [4.12.0](/guides/references/changelog#4-12-0)
  where snapshotting caused images to load too many times. Fixes
  [#8679](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8679).
- Using [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) on sites with `content-type` of
  `text-html` followed by parameters (like `text/html;charset=utf-8`) will no
  longer throw an error about visiting a site with an invalid content-type.
  Fixes [#8506](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8506)
- The `Cannot access 'continueSent' before initialization` error will no longer
  throw when using [`cy.route2()`](http). Fixes
  [#8926](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8926).
- Awaiting a request body when providing a static response stub in
  [`cy.route2()`](http) should now work properly. Addressed in
  [#9059](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9059).
- The way that intercepted [`cy.route2()`](http) requests are displayed in the
  Command Log has been improved, including showing the progress bar correctly.
  Addresses [#9053](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9053).
- The `Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined` error will no longer throw
  when attempting to generate the stack trace from an error thrown in the
  application. Fixes [#7915](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7915).
- Stack traces in the Command Log originating from application errors where the
  location is unavailable will no longer show as a clickable link to open in
  IDE. Fixes [#9106](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9106).
- When using the `fixture:` prefix as a stubbed response to
  [cy.route()](/api/commands/route), JSON fixtures containing only a number or
  boolean will no longer throw an error. Fixes
  [#4899](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4899).
- Fixed an issue causing failed subresource integrity checks for external
  scripts. Fixes [#8983](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8983),
  [#9049](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9049), and
  [#8992](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8992).

**Misc:**

- Typings for [.invoke()](/api/commands/invoke) and [.its()](/api/commands/its)
  now allow for a `timeout` option. Addresses
  [#9079](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9079).
- Typings for `cy.task()` now allow for parameterizing the task return type.
  Addresses [#7136](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7136).
- A clearer error is printed during `cypress cache list` when no cached versions
  are found. Addresses
  [#6303](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6303).
