## 0.9.4

_Released 07/06/2015_

**Features:**

- [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains), [`cy.get()`](/api/commands/get),
  and `traversal commands` will now all log out heir last known `$el` on
  failure. This means the `$el` will be highlight during Command Log hovering,
  and will display in the console on click. his should make debugging failed DOM
  based commands much easier. Fixes
  [#52](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/52).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed edge case with [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) and command
  options `visible` and `exist` where it would always fail ven though the
  matched element was in the correct state.

**Misc:**

- [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) now throws when provided the command
  option: `length` because it will only ever return 1 element.
