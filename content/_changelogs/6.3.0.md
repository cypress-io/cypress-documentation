## 6.3.0

_Released 1/19/2021_

**Features:**

- [**Cypress Studio**](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-studio) provides a visual way to generate tests within the Test Runner, by _recording interactions_ against the application under test. Cypress Studio is an experimental feature that can be enabled by adding the [experimentalStudio](/guides/references/experiments) attribute to your configuration, `cypress.json` by default. Address [#73](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/73).
- **You can now test file downloads in Cypress** without the download prompt displaying. Any files downloaded while testing file downloads will be stored in the [downloadsFolder](/guides/references/configuration#Downloads) which is set to `cypress/downloads` by default. The `downloadsFolder` will be deleted before each run unless [trashAssetsBeforeRuns](/guides/references/configuration#Downloads) is set to `false`. Addresses [#949](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/949).

**Bugfixes:**

- When an uncaught exception is thrown outside a suite with an `.only`, the error will now correctly display in the Command Log. Fixes [#14455](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14455).
- Cypress will no longer crash when no record key is provided to the `--key` flag when followed by other CLI flags. Fixed [#14593](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14593).
- Extra screenshots will no longer be taken when tests are retried when there is a failure in an `afterEach` hook. Fixes [#9209](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9209).
- Having `waitForAnimations` set to `false` no longer affects whether Cypress fires actions on inner elements. Fixes [#14370](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14370).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "5.0.0" changelog-5-0-0 %} that would cause string `CYPRESS_` prefixed env variables containing commas to be parsed as multiple values. Fixes [#8818](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8818).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "4.9.0" changelog-4-9-0 %} where asserting `have.value` on an undefined subject would throw an error. Fixes [#14359](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14359).
- We updated the CDP connection to attempt to use the stdio transport first with Chrome 72 and above, before falling back to using TCP. This should remediate issues causing sporadic "Cypress failed to make a connection to the Chrome DevTools Protocol after retrying" errors. Fixes [#6540](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6540), [#7450](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7450), [#8674](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8674), and [#8986](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8986).

**Misc:**

- We removed several Chrome flags that are no longer supported. Addressed in [#14582](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14582).
- You can now open the actively running spec file in your IDE. Addressed in [#14521](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14521).
