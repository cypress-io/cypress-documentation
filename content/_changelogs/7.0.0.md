**Summary:**

**Breaking Changes:**

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> Please read our [Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 7.0.**

- We introduced several breaking changes to [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). See the [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) docs for full usage examples. Breaking changes:
  - Request handlers supplied to `cy.intercept()` are now matched starting with the most recently defined request interceptor. This allows users to override request handlers by calling `cy.intercept()` again. This matches the previous behavior that was default in `cy.route()`. Addresses [#9302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9302).
  - `cy.intercept()` now automatically parses more JSON MIME types, including 'application/vnd.api+json'. You can now remove `JSON.parse(req.body)` or `JSON.parse(res.body)` from some tests that previously required it. Addresses [#14763](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14763).
  - Falsy values (with the exception of `undefined`) supplied as the body of a `StaticResponse` to `cy.intercept()` will now be JSONified and sent as the body. Previously, an empty string was sent instead. Addresses [#15234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15234) and [#14205](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14205).
  - The `matchUrlAgainstPath` `RouteMatcher` property has been removed from `cy.intercept()`.
  - The "substring match" from `cy.intercept()` URL matching has been removed. Previously, a URL would match if it contained the supplied string anywhere. Now, the URL (including querystring) only matches if it is an equality match or a minimatch.
  - The `delay` option for StaticResponses used with `cy.intercept()` has been removed. Please go back to using the `delayMS` option. Addresses [#15255](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15255).
  - `cy.route2()` was previously aliased to `cy.intercept()`. Now the alias `cy.route2()` has been removed. Please update usage of `cy.route2()` to `cy.intercept()`. Addressed in [#14709](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14709).
- Cypress now catches uncaught errors and fails the test even if the application under test has defined `window.onerror`. Addresses [#8802](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/8802).
- Cypress now fails tests if there is an unhandled promise rejection in the application under test. Unhandled rejections will trigger the `uncaught:exception` event with the promise as the third argument. Addresses [#243](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/243)
- Cypress now throws an error if the application under test redirects more than 20 times. The number of times allowed to redirect is configurable via the `redirectionLimit` config. Addresses [#14445](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14445).
- The default preprocessor now targets a more modern version of ECMAScript. Addressed in [#15274](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15274).
- We now enable [`contextIsolation`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) by default in the Electron browser. You can override this option if needed within the `before:browser:launch` API. Addressed in [#15493](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15493).
- `Cypress.moment()` has been removed. Please migrate to a different datetime formatter. See [our recipe](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes/tree/master/examples/blogs__dayjs) for example replacements. Addresses [#8714](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8714).
- The bundled Node.js version was upgraded from `12.18.3` to `14.16.0`. This could change the behavior of code within the `pluginsFile` when using the bundled Node.js version of Cypress. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292).
- Installing Cypress on your system now requires Node.js 12+. Addresses [#9545](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9545).

**Features:**

- You can now pass runner specific configuration in order to pass different configuration values to `component` tests versus `e2e` tests. Addressed in [#15526](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15526).
- A command log entry is now displayed when there is an uncaught exception or unhandled rejection. Addresses [#8236](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8236).
- We added several features to [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). See the [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) docs for full usage examples. Addressed in [#14543](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14543). New features:
  - There are new events on the req object for `cy.intercept()` including `before:response`, `response`, and `after:response`.
  - Response handlers (supplied via event handlers or via `req.continue(cb)`) supplied to `cy.intercept()` will be called in reverse order until `res.send` is called or until there are no more response handlers.
  - A new option, `middleware`, has been added to the `RouteMatcher` type. If true, the supplied request handler will be called before any non-middleware request handlers.
  - A new function, `req.continue(cb)`, is available on request objects yielded by `cy.intercept()`. It is functionally the same as `req.reply(cb)` - the request will stop propagating to other event handlers, will be sent outgoing, and the response will be handled by cb.
  - `cy.intercept()` can now be called with a new overload: `cy.intercept(url, routeMatcher, handler)`. `routeMatcher` will be merged with `url`, and the handler is required.
- There's a new keyboard shortcut (`ctrl/cmd + f`) to search spec files in the Test Runner based on your OS. Addresses [#6229](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6229).
- You can now create a new spec file directly from the Test Runner in the Desktop. Addressed in [#15335](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15335).
- `cy.tick()` now accepts a `log` option. Addresses [#15180](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15180).
- The Cypress proxy now adds a `keep-alive` header to all proxy responses. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292)
- Cypress no longer forces specific `NODE_OPTIONS`. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292)

**Bugfixes:**

- The `response.body` of `cy.intercept()` is now correct after stubbing a response using `res.send({ fixture })` in a `req.continue` callback or a `before:response` or `response` handler. Addressed in [#14543](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14543).
- Fixed an issue where only the first matching alias for a route would yield a response object on `cy.wait()`. Fixes [#14522](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14522).
- `cy.click()` will no longer fail with "coordsHistory must be at least 2 sets of coords" when specifying `{ multiple: true }`. Fixes [#3738](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3738).
- Errors `Refused to apply style` are gone from the console in `open-ct` during Component Testing. Addressed in [#15661](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15661).
- Some memory leaks were fixed in `@cypress/vue`. Addressed in [#15275](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15275).

**Documentation Changes:**

- Our [Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) has a new section for 7.0 migration.

**Misc:**

- The types for `set-cookie` allow `string[]`, so the headers type has been changed to reflect this. Addresses [#15419](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15419).
- The type definition for `cy.writeFile()` now allows 4 arguments. Addresses [#15353](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15353).
- `.then()` will show correct type when raw HTMLElements are provided. Addresses [#14875](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14875)
- The Cypress Studio icon now displays properly for tests with long titles. Addresses [#15182](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15182).

**Dependency Updates**

- Upgraded Chrome browser version used during `cypress run` and when selecting Electron browser in `cypress open` from `87` to `89`. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292).
- Upgraded bundled Node.js version from `12.18.3` to `14.16.0`. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292).
- Upgraded `electron` from `11.3.0` to `12.0.0`. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292).
