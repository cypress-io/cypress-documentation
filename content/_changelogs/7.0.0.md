## 7.0.0

_Released 04/05/2021_

**Summary:**

ðŸŽ‰ Introducing the **Cypress Component Test Runner** - now in alpha. Today's
release includes a brand new test runner designed to replace your Node-based
component tests. Our Component Test Runner tests your components in the browser,
just like a user would. And, since it runs in the browser, you get to debug your
components using your favorite developer tools. Read our
[Component Testing Guide](/guides/component-testing/introduction) for more
details.

**Breaking Changes:**

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> Please read our
[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes
in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 7.0.**

- We introduced several breaking changes to
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). See the
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) docs for full usage examples.
  Breaking changes:
  - Request handlers supplied to `cy.intercept()` are now matched starting with
    the most recently defined request interceptor. This allows users to override
    request handlers by calling `cy.intercept()` again. This matches the
    previous behavior that was default in `cy.route()`. Addresses
    [#9302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9302).
  - `cy.intercept()` now automatically parses more JSON MIME types, including
    'application/vnd.api+json'. You can now remove `JSON.parse(req.body)` or
    `JSON.parse(res.body)` from some tests that previously required it.
    Addresses [#14763](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14763).
  - Falsy values (with the exception of `undefined`) supplied as the body of a
    `StaticResponse` to `cy.intercept()` will now be JSONified and sent as the
    body. Previously, an empty string was sent instead. Addresses
    [#15234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15234) and
    [#14205](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14205).
  - The `matchUrlAgainstPath` `RouteMatcher` property has been removed from
    `cy.intercept()`.
  - The "substring match" from `cy.intercept()` URL matching has been removed.
    Previously, a URL would match if it contained the supplied string anywhere.
    Now, the URL (including querystring) only matches if it is an equality match
    or a minimatch.
  - `res.delay()` and `res.throttle()` have been renamed to `res.setDelay()` and
    `res.setThrottle()`, respectively. Addresses
    [#15700](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15700).
  - `cy.route2()` was previously aliased to `cy.intercept()`. Now the alias
    `cy.route2()` has been removed. Please update usage of `cy.route2()` to
    `cy.intercept()`. Addressed in
    [#14709](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14709).
- Component tests have been migrated to use a dedicated test runner and are
  bundled differently. See the
  [Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide#Component-Testing) for
  full examples on how to migrate. Addressed in
  [#14479](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14479).
  - Component tests will not be executed when running `cypress open` or
    `cypress run`. Now, they need to be executed by running `cypress open-ct` or
    `cypress run-ct`. Addressed in
    [#15701](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15701).
  - `experimentalComponentTesting` must be removed from your configuration file,
    `cypress.json` by default, or it will throw an error. Addressed in
    [#15701](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15701).
  - The `file:preprocessor` event is no longer used to compile component tests.
    Now, a `dev-server:start` event must be registered.
- Cypress now catches uncaught errors and fails the test even if the application
  under test has defined `window.onerror`. Addresses
  [#8802](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/8802).
- Cypress now fails tests if there is an unhandled promise rejection in the
  application under test. Unhandled rejections will trigger the
  `uncaught:exception` event with the promise as the third argument. Addresses
  [#243](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/243).
- Cypress now throws an error if the application under test redirects more than
  20 times. The number of times allowed to redirect is configurable via the
  [`redirectionLimit`](guides/references/configuration#Global) config. Addresses
  [#14445](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14445).
- The default preprocessor now targets a more modern version of ECMAScript.
  Addressed in [#15274](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15274).
- We now enable
  [`contextIsolation`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation)
  by default in the Electron browser. You can override this option if needed
  within the `before:browser:launch` API. Addressed in
  [#15493](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15493).
- `Cypress.moment()` has been removed. Please migrate to a different datetime
  formatter. See
  [our recipe](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes/tree/master/examples/blogs__dayjs)
  for example replacements. Addresses
  [#8714](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8714).
- The bundled Node.js version was upgraded from `12.18.3` to `14.16.0`. This
  could change the behavior of code within the `pluginsFile` when using the
  [bundled Node.js version](guides/references/configuration#Node-version) of
  Cypress. Addressed in
  [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292).
- Installing Cypress on your system now requires Node.js 12+. Addresses
  [#9545](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9545).
- The default headless browser window size has been increased to 1920x1080
  pixels to capture
  [High-definition videos and screenshots](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2021/03/01/generate-high-resolution-videos-and-screenshots/).
  Addresses [#15752](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15752),
  [#15730](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15730), and
  [#15481](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15481).

**Features:**

- A command log entry is now displayed when there is an uncaught exception or
  unhandled rejection. Addresses
  [#8236](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8236).
- We added several features to [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). See
  the [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) docs for full usage examples.
  Addressed in [#14543](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14543). New
  features:
  - There are new events on the req object for `cy.intercept()` including
    `before:response`, `response`, and `after:response`.
  - Response handlers (supplied via event handlers or via `req.continue(cb)`)
    supplied to `cy.intercept()` will be called in reverse order until
    `res.send` is called or until there are no more response handlers.
  - A new option, `middleware`, has been added to the `RouteMatcher` type. If
    true, the supplied request handler will be called before any non-middleware
    request handlers.
  - A new function, `req.continue(cb)`, is available on request objects yielded
    by `cy.intercept()`. It is functionally the same as `req.reply(cb)` - the
    request will stop propagating to other event handlers, will be sent
    outgoing, and the response will be handled by cb.
  - `cy.intercept()` can now be called with a new overload:
    `cy.intercept(url, routeMatcher, handler)`. `routeMatcher` will be merged
    with `url`, and the handler is required.
- [`cy.visit()`](api/commands/visit) can now visit pages with
  `application/xhtml*` content-type. Addresses
  [#15738](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15738).
- You can now pass runner specific configuration in order to pass different
  configuration values to `component` tests versus `e2e` tests. Addressed in
  [#15526](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15526).
- There's a new keyboard shortcut (`ctrl/cmd + f`) to search spec files in the
  Test Runner based on your OS. Addresses
  [#6229](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6229).
- You can now create a new spec file directly from the Test Runner in the
  Desktop. Addressed in
  [#15335](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15335).
- [`cy.tick()`](api/commands/tick) now accepts a `log` option. Addresses
  [#15180](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15180).
- The Cypress proxy now adds a `keep-alive` header to all proxy responses.
  Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292)
- Cypress no longer forces specific `NODE_OPTIONS`. Addressed in
  [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292)

**Bugfixes:**

- The `response.body` of [`cy.intercept()`](api/commands/intercept) is now
  correct after stubbing a response using `res.send({ fixture })` in a
  `req.continue` callback or a `before:response` or `response` handler.
  Addressed in [#14543](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14543).
- Fixed an issue where only the first matching alias for a route would yield a
  response object on [`cy.wait()`](api/commands/wait). Fixes
  [#14522](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14522).
- [`.click()`](api/commands/click) will no longer fail with "coordsHistory must
  be at least 2 sets of coords" when specifying `{ multiple: true }`. Fixes
  [#3738](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3738).
- Cypress now checks visibility correctly when an element has CSS "position:
  sticky". Fixes [#14938](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14938).
- After selecting a project in global mode and clicking the back button, Cypress
  will no longer crash. Fixes
  [#15089](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15089).
- Errors `Refused to apply style` are gone from the console in `open-ct` during
  Component Testing. Addressed in
  [#15661](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15661).
- Some memory leaks were fixed in `@cypress/vue`. Addressed in
  [#15275](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15275).

**Misc:**

- The types for `set-cookie` allow `string[]`, so the header's type has been
  changed to reflect this. Addresses
  [#15419](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15419).
- The type definition for [`cy.writeFile()`](api/commands/writefile) now allows
  4 arguments. Addresses
  [#15353](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15353).
- [`.then()`](api/commands/then) will show the correct type when raw
  HTMLElements are provided. Addresses
  [#14875](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14875)
- The Cypress Studio icon now displays properly for tests with long titles.
  Addresses [#15182](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15182).
- There were some minor improvements made to the UI when setting up a project in
  the Test Runner. Addressed in
  [#15665](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15665).

**Dependency Updates**

- Upgraded Chrome browser version used during `cypress run` and when selecting
  Electron browser in `cypress open` from `87` to `89`. Addressed in
  [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292).
- Upgraded bundled Node.js version from `12.18.3` to `14.16.0`. Addressed in
  [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292).
- Upgraded `electron` from `11.3.0` to `12.0.0`. Addressed in
  [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292).
