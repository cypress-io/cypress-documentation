## 0.17.5

_Released 10/02/2016_

**Features:**

- We've added `JUnit` as a valid
  [built-in reporters](/guides/tooling/reporters). Fixes
  [#178](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/178).
- You can now
  [add or write your own custom reporters](/guides/tooling/reporters). This
  means you can `npm install xyz-mocha-reporter` and we'll automatically
  correctly `require` that package. Alternatively you can write your own
  `xyz-custom_reporter.js` file. Fixes
  [#231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/231).
- The `reporter` can now be resized. We persist this state locally so it should
  "stick" between browser launches / app restarts. Fixes
  [#204](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/204).
- Cypress now "remembers" the last browser you had open and will suggest opening
  that whenever a project is opened. Addresses
  [#193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/193).
- Instead of seeing `Script error.` - cross origins script errors are now
  handled specially and we throw a very long and exciting error explaining what
  just happened. Fixes [#241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/241).
- When uncaught errors are thrown in hooks we now indicate Mocha's behavior as
  part of the error - that it is skipping the remaining tests in the current
  suite. Fixes [#240](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/240).

**Bugfixes:**

- The reporter now more intelligently scrolls to prevent commands from being cut
  off. Useful in screenshots / video recording. Fixes
  [#228](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/228).
- We've improved the logic of how snapshots are restored so that it does not
  break the CSS when there were full page navigations in the test and the CSS
  changed. Fixes [#223](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/223).
- Iframes are now correctly handled when we restore snapshots. Previously, we
  removed iframes which would change the page layout and the hitboxes'
  coordinates we drew were wrong. Now we insert iframe placeholders that prevent
  the page layout from changing. Fixes
  [#234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/234).
- Snapshot hitboxes no longer incorrectly draw for elements that are hidden.
  Fixes [#251](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/251).
- Fixed a bug that caused commands to time out on subsequent tests whenever
  there was an uncaught error + an assertion conflict. Fixes
  [#238](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/238).
- Fixed an edge case where assertions would incorrectly associate to a
  previously run assertion. Fixes
  [#252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/252).
- Cypress commands now correctly execute in `after` and `afterEach` hooks on a
  failed test. Previously they would only run on passing tests. Fixes
  [#203](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/203).

**Misc:**

- We've bypassed Mocha's default uncaught error handling and replaced it with
  something much better - actually using the thrown error instances instead of
  creating a new arbitrary one. This means you'll see better stack traces on
  uncaught errors. Fixes
  [#193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/193).
- We've bypassed Mocha's default uncaught error handling in a `hook`. Normally
  this immediately ends the run. Instead we are skipping the remaining tests in
  the current suite. This prevents skipping potentially dozens or hundreds of
  tests downstream that are typically unrelated to the hook failure.
- We've updated `cypress-cli` package to `0.12.0`. You will need to download
  this new CLI version if you want to pass `--reporter-options`.
- Bumped the internal version of `mocha` from `2.2.1` to `2.4.5`.
