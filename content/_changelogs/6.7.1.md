## 6.7.1

_Released 3/15/2021_

**Bugfixes:**

- Interacting with an element that requires scrolling within an element with
  `scroll-behavior: smooth` no longer fails Cypress's actionability check. Fixes
  [#15453](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15453).
- A regression in [6.7.0](#6-7-0) has been fixed so that the `projectId` will be
  written correctly to the `cypress.json` file on initial creation without an
  extra config object. Fixes
  [#15497](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15497).
