## 1.3.0

*Released 12/17/2017*

**Features:**

- Plugins now emit a [before:browser:launch](/guides/tooling/plugins-guide#Browser-Launching) event exposing you the browser that will be launched and its launch arguments. This enables you to modify the arguments prior to launching the browser. You can also use these arguments to modify how Chrome runs and to also test Chrome extensions. Fixes [#691](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/691) and [#298](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/298).
- We have launched a "CSS Selector Playground", a new UI button in the Test Runner that enables you to highlight elements in your application and receive a unique selector. You can also find elements by their text content. These mimics [cy.get()](/api/commands/get) and [cy.contains()](/api/commands/contains) behavior. Additionally you can copy the generated Cypress command to your clipboard or output the generated selector to your console. This feature is in beta. It only works in Chrome (not in Electron). We are aware of some bugs in it, but it is good enough for use and feedback. Please check out issue [#917](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/917), watch an animated gif demonstration, and leave any feedback you have there. Fixes [#917](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/917).
