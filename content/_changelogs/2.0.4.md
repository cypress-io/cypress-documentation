## 2.0.4

*Released 2/25/2018*

**Bugfixes:**

- The `cypress` npm package now has the correct `engines` set in `package.json`. This was accidentally getting overwritten and caused errors when `engineStrict` was set in environments using `node` older than `8.2.1`. Fixes [#1373](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1373).
