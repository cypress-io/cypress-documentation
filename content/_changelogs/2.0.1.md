## 2.0.1

*Released 2/16/2018*

**Bugfixes:**

- Using [cy.contains()](/api/commands/contains) with a RegExp argument is now properly escaped. Fixes [#1322](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1322).
- Fixed a runaway RegExp causing large `.js` files to take dozens of seconds to process. This was a regression caused by `2.0.0` with the new [modifyObstructiveCode](/guides/references/configuration#Browser) option. We've optimized the RegExp and the performance is back to being almost identical to transparently passing responses through. Fixes [#1330](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1330).
