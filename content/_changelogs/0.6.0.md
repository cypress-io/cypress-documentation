## 0.6.0

_Released 05/14/2015_

**Features:**

- Pushstate application routing now works 100% reliably with NO hacky overrides
  in all browsers.
- All incompatible `a` / `link` / `form` elements are transparently rewritten to
  be compatible including FQDN and protocol-less `href` / `src`.
- Cookies are automatically cleared between page refreshes, during app startup,
  and leaving the test page.
- 3rd Party cookies are now additionally cleared. All cookies are now accessible
  to the client in preparation for
  [`cy.clearCookies()`](/api/commands/clearcookies).
- Manual navigation after tests run now works reliably.
- Navigating between full page refreshes during tests now works reliably.

**Bugfixes:**

- Server-side redirects are now completely transparently handled and supported.
- URLs are no longer altered in any weird way.
- Problematic `headers` are now automatically stripped from remote responses.
- 3rd party `headers` are now properly proxied onto all responses.
- Custom headers and other headers "of interest" are rewritten for transparent
  compatibility.
- `gzip` compression now handled and proxied correctly.

**Misc:**

- Completely overhauled the URL and proxy system used to serve remote
  applications.
- Drastically simplified the architecture required for proxying.
- Improved reliability for displaying the remote url.
- Namespaced all cypress internal routes.
- Many internal development / debugging processes improved.
- Added 100+ new tests surrounding serving remote content and processing
  requests.
- Renamed all remaining old references to `eclectus`.
- All responses are now streamed using `content-encoding: chunked`.
