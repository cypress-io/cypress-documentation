## 8.5.0

_Released 09/27/2021_

**Features:**

- You can now select an option by index within the
  [`.select()`](/api/commands/select) command. Addresses
  [#757](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/757).
- Cypress now captures the repository URL on Drone CI. Addresses
  [#18210](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18210).

**Bugfixes:**

- The download of Cypress now respects the `NO_PROXY` environment variable when
  one is set. Fixes
  [#17702](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17702).
- When using a custom config file and setting it up to record to the Dashboard,
  Cypress now writes the `projectId` in the custom config file instead of
  `cypress.json`. Fixes
  [#5747](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5747).

**Misc:**

- Windows 32-bit has been deprecated and support will be removed in a later
  release. A deprecation warning will now display when using Cypress in a
  Windows 32-bit OS. See
  [#17962](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17962) for more detail.
  Addresses [#18094](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18094).
