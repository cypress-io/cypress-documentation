## 9.5.1

_Released 2/28/2022_

**Features:**

- Support for node's experimental `--loader` feature for plugins has been
  enabled. Addressed in
  [#19792](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19792).

**Bugfixes:**

- Added a `ready` event to the Plugins process to ensure all plugins have
  successfully started before the configuration is loaded and the tests start.
  This fixes an issue where the plugin is never executed and leaves Cypress
  stuck in the initialization phase, where the user can only view the loading
  spinner. Fixed in
  [#19792](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19792).
- Made a change to the DNS lookup to improve test performances and reliability
  on MacOS machines that leverage the VMWare CBCloud SaaS solution. Before this
  changes, random test failures were observed, as well as hanging tests and
  initially pending http and https responses. Fixed in
  [#20062](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20062).
- Fixed a regression in [9.5.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-5-0) where ansi
  colors were not removed from the `cy.fixtures()` error code frame. Fixes
  [#20208](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20208).
- Fixed an issue where Cypress would throw an error when reporting or wrapping
  errors with booleans or numbers. Fixes
  [#19561](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19561).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `url-parse` dependency from `1.5.2` to `1.5.6` to avoid authorization
  bypass through user-controlled key to address this
  [NVD security vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0512).
  Addressed in [#20270](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20270).
