## 3.2.0

_Released 3/15/2019_

**Features:**

- [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) has been expanded to allow options `url`,
  `method`, `body`, and `headers`. This allows [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit)
  to be called with a `POST` method or with headers like `Accept-Language` or
  `Authorization`. Fixes
  [#1500](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1500),
  [#1904](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1904) and
  [#908](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/908).
- [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) now allows any valid HTTP `method` to be
  used including `TRACE`, `COPY`, `LOCK`, `MKCOL`, `MOVE`, `PURGE`, `PROPFIND`,
  `PROPPATCH`, `UNLOCK`, `REPORT`, `MKACTIVITY`, `CHECKOUT`, `MERGE`,
  `M-SEARCH`, `NOTIFY`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `UNSUBSCRIBE`, `SEARCH`, and `CONNECT`.
  Addresses [#1302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1302)
- The
  [`--browser` argument](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-browser-lt-browser-name-or-path-gt)
  of the [Command Line](/guides/guides/command-line) and the
  [`browser` argument](/guides/guides/module-api#cypress-run) of the
  [Module API](/guides/guides/module-api) have been updated to allow passing a
  `<path>`. Addresses
  [#1026](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1026).
- [cy.type()](/api/commands/type) now accepts `{home}` and `{end}` special
  character sequences to move the cursor to the start or end of a line.
  Addresses [#2033](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2033).
- The Cypress Chrome extension now has a static ID of
  `caljajdfkjjjdehjdoimjkkakekklcck`. This allows Cypress to be added to your
  allowed extensions for those working under corporate policies that prohibit
  extensions. Addresses
  [#3673](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3673),
  [#1239](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1239) and
  [#2494](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2494).

**Bugfixes:**

- Problems logging in through GitHub in the Test Runner have been fixed. The
  GitHub login window no longer shows the browser support banner and the
  "Authorize cypress-io" button is no longer disabled. Fixes
  [#1251](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1251).
- Fixed an issue when testing applications using older versions of jQuery. They
  now no longer throw `item.first is not a function`. Fixes
  [#2927](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2927).
- Cypress now detects more instances of `browser` installations. Fixes
  [#3183](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3183) and
  [#3218](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3218).
- Fixed issue with loading fixture files containing more than one `.` in their
  filename while not specifying the file extension. We are also displaying a
  clearer warning when a fixture file cannot be found. Fixes
  [#1402](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1402).
- All third party `@types` have been moved from Cypress `dependencies` into
  `devDependencies`. This should fix situations where user's type dependencies
  were conflicting with Cypress's third party type definitions. Fixes
  [#3371](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3371) and
  [#1227](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1227).
- `Cypress.config('baseUrl')` has been updated to no longer strip singular `/`
  at the end of urls and instead only strip instances of multiple `/`. Fixes
  [#3540](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3540).
- The prompt to "Restore pages?" is no longer displayed within Chrome upon
  restarting a crashed Chrome window. Addresses
  [#2048](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2048).
- [cy.wrap()](/api/commands/wrap) no longer throws an error when a non-jQuery
  wrapped DOM element is passed in as an argument. Fixes
  [#3549](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3549).
- Fixed issue where all arguments passed to `setTimeout` or `setInterval` were
  not properly passed on to the target function. Fixes
  [#3592](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3592).
- [.filter()](/api/commands/filter) has been updated so that when called with a
  function, the options are now properly read. Fixes
  [#3315](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3315).
- Cypress's recognition of websites attempting framebusting has been updated to
  include framebusting code wrapped within `()`.
  [#3267](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3267)
- When `.its()` returns `undefined` it no longer errors. It will now follow the
  same logic as all other commands and only fail when directly by a
  [.should()](/api/commands/should) command with an assertion that is not met.
  Fixes [#1531](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1531).
- When [cy.wrap()](/api/commands/wrap) is followed directly by a
  [.should()](/api/commands/should) command, `cy.wrap()` will now
  [retry](/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability) when its argument evaluates to
  `undefined` until it meets the requirements of the assertion or the
  `cy.wrap()` command times out. Fixes
  [#3241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3241).

**Misc:**

- We now display a warning when passing an argument to `--spec` that is not
  surrounded by quotes `""` recommending that the argument instead be surrounded
  by quotes. In some cases, not providing quotes can cause the arguments to be
  read in a way that is likely not its intended use. Addresses
  [#3318](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3318) and
  [#2298](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2298).
- The number of logs printed when installing Cypress in docker has been reduced.
  Partially addresses
  [#1243](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1243).
- The seeded Kitchen Sink examples have some new examples showing how to add a
  message to assertions, how to compare the text content of two elements, and
  how to make assertions about `data` attributes. The examples also have some
  small typo fixes. Fixes
  [#502](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/502). Addressed in
  [#3272](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3272),
  [#3287](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3287), and
  [#3700](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3700).
- We now only mount internal servers on `loopback`. Addresses
  [#3712](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3712).
- The instructions in Cypress's update window now include `yarn` update
  instructions alongside `npm`. Addresses
  [#2871](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2871).
- The spec file's font weight has been increased within the Test Runner for
  better readability. Addressed in
  [#3065](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3065).
- We improved the error message displayed when a record key is unrecognized
  during `cypress run`. Addresses
  [#1449](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1449).
- We improved the typings when using `Cypress.on` to listen for `window.alert`
  events to allow for `Sinon.stub`. Fixes
  [#3451](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3451).
- Fixed typo in typing for [.trigger](/api/commands/trigger) options. Addressed
  in [#3588](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3588).
