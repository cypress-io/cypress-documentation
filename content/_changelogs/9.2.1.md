# 9.2.1

_Released 1/10/2022_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in [9.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-2-0) to keep
  Cypress open after each spec finishes when the `--headed --no-exit` flags are
  passed to `cypress run`. Fixes
  [#19485](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19485).
- Improve heuristic for verifying when the `--openssl-legacy-provider` option
  should be passed to the plugins' child process when the system Node version is
  v17+. This prevents Cypress from crashing when a user has Node 17 installed
  which was built with OpenSSL v1. Fixes
  [#19320](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19320).
- Correctly cast the `CYPRESS_VERIFY_TIMEOUT` environment variable as a number
  so Cypress will no longer throw
  `TypeError: Expected the timeout option to be a non-negative integer`. Fixes
  [#19476](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19476).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Update pinned resolution of `cli-table3` from `~0.6.0` to `~0.6.1` to avoid
  problems with the bug introduced in the
  [colors.js v1.4.44-liberty-2 release](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/issues/285).
  Addresses [#19624](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19624).
