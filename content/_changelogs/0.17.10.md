## 0.17.10

_Released 11/07/2016_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed switching between two different spec files from the desktop app causing
  `document.domain` to be wrong. Fixes
  [#276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/276).
- Fixed inserting the string `null` into [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request)
  urls when providing a `baseUrl` in `cypress.json` while origin could not be
  determined. Fixes [#274](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/274).
- Fixed incorrect error message on reverse visibility assertions. Fixes
  [#275](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/275).

**Misc:**

- We've improved the way we inject content into `<html>` responses by filtering
  the underlying HTTP request headers. We no longer inject content into
  templates which were loaded via XHR. Fixes
  [#257](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/257) and
  [#288](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/288).
