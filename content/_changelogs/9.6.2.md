## 9.6.2

_Released 5/23/2022_

**Deprecations:**

- The `Cypress.Cookies.preserveOnce()` and `Cypress.Cookies.defaults()` Cypress
  APIs have been deprecated. In a future release, support for
  `Cypress.Cookies.preserveOnce()` and `Cypress.Cookies.defaults()` will be
  removed. Consider using the [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) command
  instead to cache and restore cookies and other sessions details between tests.
  Fixed [#21333](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21333).

**Bugfixes:**

- Updated the [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) command to correctly
  error and retry if the provided regex pattern begins with an equal sign and a
  match was not initially found. Previously the command would incorrectly fail
  with a syntax error. Fixed
  [#21108](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21108).
- Corrected the `cy.session()` command log grouping and validation verbiage.
  This change provides better insights to logs associated with the command.
  Fixed [#21377](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21377).
- Removed `eventemitter2` third-party type definitions from `cy` and `Cypress`
  that were unintentionally exposed. Fixed
  [#20556](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20556).
