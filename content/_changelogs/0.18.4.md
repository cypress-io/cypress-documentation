## 0.18.4

_Released 12/28/2016_

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent [`cy.url()`](/api/commands/url) from accessing the URL during
  transition phase and throwing an error. Fixes
  [#356](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/356).
- Stubbed functions now serialize correctly when switching domains on a
  [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit). Fixes
  [#354](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/354).
- Fixed a handful of scenarios and edge cases where cookies were not properly
  synchronized between external requests and the browser. This led to situations
  where cookies were either duplicated on requests, or were not sent. Fixes
  [#357](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/357) and
  [#361](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/361) and
  [#362](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/362).

**Misc:**

- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) now favors `baseUrl` config over
  remote origin when you do not pass a fully qualified URL. Fixes
  [#360](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/360).
