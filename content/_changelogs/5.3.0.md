## 5.3.0

_Released 9/28/2020_

**Features:**

- Firefox support is now out of beta! 🎉 Firefox 80 and newer are now officially stable when used with Cypress. Addresses [#8241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8241).
  - Versions of Firefox older than 80 can still be used, but will be subject to the `firefoxGcInterval` workaround. The desktop GUI will display a warning if such versions are used.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a bug where [`cy.route2()`](http) would not automatically JSONify an empty array handler. Addresses [#8532](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8532).
- Fixed a bug where objects yielded by using `cy.wait` on a [`cy.route2()`](http) alias would not always have a `response` property. Addresses [#8536](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8536).
- Fixed an issue where [`cy.route2()`](http) routes would not be able to intercept requests to HTTPS destinations on a different origin. Addresses [#8487](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8487).
- Fixed an issue where subjects became `undefined` after certain assertion failures. Addresses [#5763](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5763).
- Fixed an issue where a `cy.task` with no arguments passed would receive `null` as the first argument instead of `undefined`. Addresses [#5913](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5913).
- Fixed an issue preventing users from passing the config-file argument when starting cypress through the node module API. Addresses [#8632](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8632).
- Fixed an issue where `cy.visit()`s to a relative URL containing `..` would not work. Addresses [#5090](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5090).
- Fixed an issue where Mocha hooks could still be triggered after the Test Runner was manually stopped. Addresses [#8621](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8621).
- Fixed an issue where `cy.setCookie` failed when given a cookie name with a `__Host-` prefix. Addresses [#8261](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8261).
- Fixed an issue where a misleading error was displayed when test code threw an exception with a non-`Error` object. Addresses [#7870](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7870).

**Misc:**

- The proxy now omits the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header the same way that it does for `Content-Security-Policy`. Addresses [#7936](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7936).
- Added a `status` property to `CypressRunResult` objects. Addresses [#8580](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8580).
- Updated types to no longer use deprecated Mocha interfaces. Addresses [#5795](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5795).
- Passing an empty string to `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` now takes precedence over npm config. Addresses [#8488](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8488).
