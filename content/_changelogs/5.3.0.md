## 5.3.0

_Released 9/28/2020_

**Features:**

- Firefox support is now out of beta! ðŸŽ‰ Firefox 80 and newer are now officially
  stable when used with Cypress. Addresses
  [#8241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8241).
  - Versions of Firefox older than 80 can still be used, but will be subject to
    the `firefoxGcInterval` workaround. The desktop GUI will display a warning
    if such versions are used.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a bug where [`cy.route2()`](http) would not automatically JSONify an
  empty array handler. Addresses
  [#8532](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8532).
- Fixed a bug where objects yielded by using `cy.wait` on a
  [`cy.route2()`](http) alias would not always have a `response` property.
  Addresses [#8536](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8536).
- Fixed an issue where [`cy.route2()`](http) routes would not be able to
  intercept requests to HTTPS destinations on a different origin. Addresses
  [#8487](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8487).
- Fixed an issue where subjects became `undefined` after certain assertion
  failures. Addresses
  [#5763](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5763).
- Fixed an issue where a `cy.task` with no arguments passed would receive `null`
  as the first argument instead of `undefined`. Addresses
  [#5913](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5913).
- Fixed an issue preventing users from passing the config-file argument when
  starting cypress through the node module API. Addresses
  [#8632](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8632).
- Fixed an issue where `cy.visit()`s to a relative URL containing `..` would not
  work. Addresses [#5090](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5090).
- Fixed an issue where Mocha hooks could still be triggered after the Test
  Runner was manually stopped. Addresses
  [#8621](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8621).
- Fixed an issue where `cy.setCookie` failed when given a cookie name with a
  `__Host-` prefix. Addresses
  [#8261](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8261).
- Fixed an issue where a misleading error was displayed when test code threw an
  exception with a non-`Error` object. Addresses
  [#7870](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7870).

**Misc:**

- The proxy now omits the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header the same
  way that it does for `Content-Security-Policy`. Addresses
  [#7936](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7936).
- Added a `status` property to `CypressRunResult` objects. Addresses
  [#8580](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8580).
- Updated types to no longer use deprecated Mocha interfaces. Addresses
  [#5795](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5795).
- Passing an empty string to `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` now takes precedence over
  npm config. Addresses
  [#8488](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8488).
