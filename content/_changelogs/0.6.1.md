## 0.6.1

_Released 05/15/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- Using the `length` option in traversal commands works properly now. Fixes
  [#38](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/38).
- Command logging now works even if no `cy` commands have been issued. Fixes
  [#37](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/37).

**Misc:**

- Removed cy proxy commands: `each`, `map`. These didn't really "fit" into the
  concept of a command, and with [`.invoke()`](/api/commands/invoke) or
  [`.its()`](/api/commands/its) they're accessible anyway, so nothing is really
  lost.
