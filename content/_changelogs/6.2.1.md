## 6.2.1

_Released 1/4/2021_

**Bugfixes:**

- Test retries, when retrying on several failed tests, will no longer cause
  hanging during `cypress run`. Fixes
  [#9040](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9040).
- `multipart/form-data` is no longer wrongly encoded when using
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). This should prevent
  `Unexpected end of multipart data` errors on the back end service where the
  request was pointing to. Fixes
  [#9359](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9359).
- [cy.contains()](/api/commands/contains) no longer throws an error when a
  single quote is used inside its argument when RegExp. Fixes
  [#8626](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8626).
- Passing `capture: 'runner'` to a [cy.screenshot()](/api/commands/screenshot)
  command inside [.within()](/api/commands/within) now screenshots the entire
  Test Runner as expected. Fixes
  [#14253](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14253).
- [Cypress.dom.isJquery()](/api/cypress-api/dom#Is-jQuery) now always returns a
  boolean instead of `undefined` sometimes. Fixes
  [#14278](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14278).
- `calledOnceWith` and `calledOnceWithExactly` sinon matchers no longer throw an
  error when used within Cypress. Fixes
  [#9644](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9644).
- We now pass `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows` as a default flag to
  Chrome to prevent backgrounding rendering when the Cypress window is occluded.
  Fixes [#9604](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9604).

**Misc:**

- After login, if a name is undefined on your profile, the Test Runner will show
  the profile's email and link to instructions to update the name. Addresses
