## 6.2.1

*Released 1/4/2021*

**Bugfixes:**

- Test retries, when retrying on several failed tests, will no longer cause hanging during `cypress run`. Fixes [#9040](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9040).
- `multipart/form-data` is no longer wrongly encoded when using [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). This should prevent `Unexpected end of multipart data` errors on the back end service where the request was pointing to. Fixes [#9359](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9359).
- [cy.contains()](/api/commands/contains) no longer throws an error when a single quote is used inside its argument when RegExp. Fixes [#8626](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8626).
- Passing `capture: 'runner'` to a [cy.screenshot()](/api/commands/screenshot) command inside [.within()](/api/commands/within) now screenshots the entire Test Runner as expected. Fixes [#14253](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14253).
- [Cypress.dom.isJquery()](/api/cypress-api/dom#Is-jQuery) now always returns a boolean instead of `undefined` sometimes. Fixes [#14278](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14278).
- `calledOnceWith` and `calledOnceWithExactly` sinon matchers no longer throw an error when used within Cypress. Fixes [#9644](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9644).
- We now pass `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows` as a default flag to Chrome to prevent backgrounding rendering when the Cypress window is occluded. Fixes [#9604](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9604).

**Misc:**

- After login, if a name is undefined on your profile, the Test Runner will show the profile's email and link to instructions to update the name. Addresses [#14288](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14288).
