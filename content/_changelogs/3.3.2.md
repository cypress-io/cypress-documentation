## 3.3.2

_Released 6/27/2019_

**Performance Improvements:**

- We fixed a regression introduced in
  [3.3.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-3-0) that was causing the Test Runner
  to do extremely unnecessary re-renders of the Command Log on any command
  change - leading to exponential performance degradation on any run. This was
  the root cause behind many users experiencing a reduction in performance when
  upgrading to `3.3.0` or above. Fixes
  [#4411](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4411) and
  [#4313](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4313).
- We reduced memory consumption and improved the performance of running tests
  anytime you're inside of `cypress open`. Fixes
  [#2366](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2366).
- We no longer delay proxied responses with no body with status codes 1xx,
  204, 304. This fixes a regression introduced in
  [3.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0) where responses with these status
  codes were delayed when using a proxy. Fixes
  [#4298](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4298).
- Snapshots were previously being mistakenly stored then instantly deleted when
  `numTestsKeptInMemory` was set to 0. We now no longer record the snapshots at
  all when `numTestsKeptInMemory` is set to 0. This should slightly improve the
  performance of running tests with this setting. Fixes
  [#4104](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4104) and
  [#4164](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4164).

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress no longer watches files when run using `cypress run`. This will fix
  some runs that were crashing with an `ENOSPC` error. Fixes
  [#4283](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4283).
- Cypress now correctly handles `blur` and `focus` events in situations where
  the browser has lost focus. Fixes
  [#4039](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4039),
  [#1176](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1176), and
  [#1486](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1486).
- If the DOM element provided to [.type()](/api/commands/type) is already in
  focus, Cypress no longer attempts to click on the DOM element. This allows you
  to call `.focus()` on elements that are focusable, but not necessarily
  clickable and type into them using `.type()`. Fixes
  [#3001](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3001) and
  [#4420](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4420).
- Some elements inside of a parent with CSS `overflow: hidden` that flow outside
  of its parent are now properly considered hidden.
  [#4161](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4161)
- Elements that are inside a parent with CSS `position: absolute` which is
  itself inside of a parent element with `overflow: hidden` are now properly
  considered visible. Fixes
  [#4395](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4395) and
  [#755](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/755).
- `<option>` and `<optgroup>` elements are now properly considered visible if it
  is contained within a visible `<select>`. Fixes
  [#4473](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4473).
- `<body>` and `<html>` elements are now properly always considered visible.
  Fixes [#4475](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4475).
- `<td>` and `<tr>` elements with CSS `visibility: collapse` are now properly
  considered hidden. Fixes
  [#4476](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4476).
- We now correctly handle form submission when using `.type('{enter}')` on a
  form containing a button of type `reset`. Fixes
  [#3909](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3909).
- If a site's `content-type` is `null`, `undefined` or cannot be determined
  during [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit), we now look at the content of the
  site and evaluate whether it looks like HTML. If it does look like HTML we no
  longer error and continue as if it the site's `content-type` is `text/html`.
  [#1727](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1727)
  [#773](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/773)
  [#3101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3101).
- Previously Cypress would send the `auth` header to any URLs that match the
  CORS origin of the original `auth` header. We now correctly only send the
  `auth` headers when there is an exact match on the
  [protection space](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-2.2). Fixes
  [#4267](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4267).
- Requests that go through [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) or
  [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) are now automatically retried on
  `ENOTFOUND` errors. Fixes
  [#4424](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4424) and
  [#1755](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1755).
- Cypress now errors when the `body` parameter passed to
  [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) contains a circular reference. Fixed in
  [#4407](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4407).
- We fixed an issue where the `ignoreTestFiles` configuration was being filtered
  out when passed via a command line flag, so in effect being ignored. Fixes
  [#1696](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1696).
- Setting `NO_PROXY` is now respected for HTTPS urls, as it should be. Fixes
  [#4303](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4303).
- When running tests with non-string test titles, the screenshots now
  automatically stringify the test titles instead of throwing an error. Fixes
  [#4310](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4310).
- Cypress no longer incorrectly errors when calling `cy.window().screenshot()`,
  `cy.window().scrollTo()` or `cy.window().trigger()` in an application with
  multiple iframes. Fixes
  [#4396](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4396).
- Fixed a regression in [3.3.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-3-0) causing some
  users using proxy to see the "Browser was not launched through Cypress" error
  during `cypress open`. This was caused by incorrectly routing requests for
  Cypress's internal server on `localhost` through the user's proxy. Fixes
  [#4410](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4410).
- We fixed situations during a test failure where the Test Runner would throw
  `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`. Fixes
  [#1958](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1958) and
  [#4346](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4346).
- Fixed issue where `window.performance.getEntriesByType` would return
  `undefined` instead of an array within application code when using
  [cy.clock()](/api/commands/clock). Fixes
  [#3625](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3625).
- Passing an array of strings to `ignoreTestFiles` no longer causes an error to
  throw. Fixes [#4312](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4312).
- Fixed a visual bug when aliasing a non-route subject multiple times that would
  cause the Test Runner to show 'undefined' alias with empty counts. Fixes
  [#4429](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4429).
- Fixed regression introduced in [3.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0)
  where Cypress would error because it could not find a type definition file for
  '../sinon'. Fixes [#4272](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4272).
- [cy.writeFile()](/api/commands/writefile) no longer errors in TypeScript files
  when passing an `options` object as its third argument. Fixes
  [#4461](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4461).
- [cy.stub()](/api/commands/stub) no longer errors in TypeScript files when
  evaluating returns. Fixes
  [#4302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4302).

**Misc:**

- Warnings are now displayed when recording in `cypress run` to warn when a
  project is nearing its organization's usage limit. They also clearly explain
  any consequences of going over a plan's usage limit. Addresses
  [#4530](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4530).
- An warning icon with a tooltip is displayed in the Runs tab of the Test Runner
  when parallelization was disabled during the run due to being over the
  organization's usage limit. Addresses
  [#4489](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4489).
- You can now opt out of sending exceptions to `https://api.cypress.io` by
  setting `CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0` in your system environment variables.
  [#4386](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4386)
- We are now capturing Google Cloud build details when recording tests to the
  Cypress Dashboard. Addresses
  [#3582](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3582).
- The tests titles and headers in the Command Log no longer truncate with
  elipsis when the text is longer than that width of the Command Log. Instead
  the text wraps so that all text is shown. Addresses
  [#3947](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3947).
- Special env vars are now truncated in `Cypress.env()` and the debug logs.
  Addresses [#4501](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4501).

  settings like all other configuration values. Fixes
  [#4500](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4500).
