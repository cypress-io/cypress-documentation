## 8.7.0

_Released 10/25/2021_

**Features:**

- There are changes to how "slow" tests are determined and displayed in Cypress.
  Addresses [#18496](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18496).
  - Added a [`slowTestThreshold`](/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts)
    configuration option to customize when tests are considered "slow" during
    `cypress run`. A test that runs slower than the given threshold will display
    in orange text in the default 'spec' reporter. This configuration can be set
    in your Cypress config file or via specific
    [test configuration](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Configuration).
  - The default slow test threshold was changed from 75ms (Mocha's default) to
    10000ms for e2e tests and 250ms for component tests. To restore the old
    behavior, you can add `"slowTestThreshold": 75` to your Cypress config file.
  - All tests will show the time the test ran in milliseconds during
    `cypress run` with the default 'spec' reporter.
- Users can pass an `overwrite: true` option to `Cypress.Screenshot.defaults` to
  change default behavior to overwrite existing screenshots without having to
  set `overwrite` for each `cy.screenshot()` command. Addresses
  [#7955](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7955).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression introduced in [8.6.0](#8-6-0) where videos recorded in
  Electron to the Dashboard were not playable in the Firefox or Safari browser
  and were not compatible with QuickTime player in MacOS.
- Fixed a regression introduced in [8.6.0](#8-6-0) so that the warning about the
  `projectRoot` directory not being writeable will now display correctly. Fixes
  [#18485](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18485).
- Improved the error message when running Cypress without non-root permissions.
  Fixes [#18445](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18445).
- An error now throws when invalid options are passed to the `selectorPriority`
  configuration option of `Cypress.SelectorPlayground.defaults`. Valid values
  are `data-*`, `id`, `class`, `tag`, `attribute`, or `nth-child`. Fixes
  [#7745](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7745).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Pinned resolution of `ua-parser-js` to `0.7.24` to avoid dependency resolution
  to the compromised package versions. Please read the
  [security advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pjwm-rvh2-c87w) and
  take actions advised as soon as possible. Addressed in
  [#18611](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18611)
