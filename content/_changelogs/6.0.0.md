## 6.0.0

_Released 11/23/2020_

**Summary:**

Cypress now offers full network stubbing support with the introduction of the
[cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) command (previously `cy.route2()`).
With [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) your tests can intercept, modify
and wait on any type of HTTP request originating from your app. See our guide on
[Migrating `cy.route()` to `cy.intercept()`](/guides/references/migration-guide#Migrating-cy-route-to-cy-intercept).

**Breaking Changes:**

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> Please read our
[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes
in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 6.0.**

- Cypress now always throws an error when asserting on an element that doesn't
  exist in the DOM (unless you're asserting that the element should
  `not.exist`). Assertions such as `not.visible`, `not.contains`,
  `not.have.class`, etc will now fail when used on non-existent DOM elements.
  Addresses [#205](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/205).
- DOM elements where the CSS style (or ancestors) are `opacity: 0` are no longer
  considered visible. However these are still considered
  [actionable](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements) and
  [any action commands](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Actionability)
  used to interact with the element will perform the action. This matches
  browser's implementation on how they regard elements with `opacity: 0`.
  Addresses [#4474](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4474).
- The type yielded by [cy.wait(alias)](/api/commands/wait) has changed in order
  to support use of [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). Addressed in
  [#9266](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9266).
- The `experimentalNetworkStubbing` option has been removed and made the default
  behavior. You can safely removed this configuration option. Addressed in
  [#9185](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9185).
- When using [.type()](/api/commands/type) and [.click()](/api/commands/click)
  on elements inside a `contenteditable` element, the events are now properly
  triggered on the inside elements. This may cause unintended consequences if
  you were relying on the previous behavior. Addressed in
  [#9066](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9066).
- We removed several deprecation errors around APIs that were removed in
  versions of Cypress prior to 4.0.0. This will not cause any changes for anyone
  upgrading from a 4.0+ version of Cypress. For a full list of all APIs affected
  see [#8946](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8946).
- We updated our HTTP status codes and reason phrases to match Node.js
  `http.STATUS_CODES`. If you have code that relies on a reason phrase, then
  this could affect you. Addressed in
  [#8969](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8969).
- JSON request and response bodies captured by
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) are now automatically parsed,
  removing the need to manually do `JSON.parse`. Addressed in
  [#9280](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9280).

**Deprecations:**

Deprecations still work as before but will be removed from Cypress in a future
release. We encourage you to update your code now to remove uses of
deprecations.

- `cy.server()` and `cy.route()` have been deprecated. In a future release,
  support for `cy.server()` and `cy.route()` will be removed. We encourage you
  to use [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) instead. See our guide on
  [Migrating `cy.route()` to `cy.intercept()`](/guides/references/migration-guide#Migrating-cy-route-to-cy-intercept).
  Addressed in [#9185](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9185).
- `experimentalFetchPolyfill` has been deprecated. We encourage you to use
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) to intercept requests using the
  Fetch API instead.
- `cy.route2()` was renamed to [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). We
  encourage you to update usages of `cy.route2()` to use
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). Addressed in
  [#9182](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9182).

**Features:**

- The new [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) command can be used to
  manage the behavior of HTTP requests at the network layer. Addressed in
  [#9182](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9182).
- We now pass `—disable-dev-shm-usage` to the Chrome browser flags by default.
  This will write shared memory files into `/tmp` instead of `/dev/shm`. If
  you're passing this flag in your `plugins` file, you can now remove this code.
  Addresses [#5336](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5336).
- A warning is now displayed when passing invalid configuration keys through the
  CLI. Addresses [#428](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/428).
- The `cypress version` command now also displays the current Electron and
  bundled Node versions. Addresses
  [#9180](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9180).
- The `cypress version` command now accepts a `--component` flag that allows you
  to print the version of specific components of Cypress. ie Electron, Node,
  etc. Addresses [#9214](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9214).

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression introduced in
  [3.5.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-5-0) that would cause
  [.type()](/api/commands/type) to not type the entire string when focus was
  called away from the target element. Fixes
  [#9254](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9254).
- [.type()](/api/commands/type) and [.click()](/api/commands/click) now properly
  work on elements inside a `contenteditable` element. Fixes
  [#2717](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2717) and
  [#7721](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7721).
- We fixed a regression introduced in
  [5.6.0](/guides/references/changelog#5-6-0) that would cause the Test Runner
  to crashes and display a white page when switching tabs while tests are
  running. Fixes [#9151](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9151).
- Fixed an issue where `Content-Length` for `cy.route2` request bodies could be
  incorrectly recalculated. Fixes
  [#9166](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9166).

**Documentation Changes:**

- Our [Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) has a new section
  for 6.0 migration.
- Many of our docs examples have been updated to use
  [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) in place of `cy.route()` including
  our [Network Requests](/guides/guides/network-requests) doc.

**Misc:**

- Added the type of `redirects` and changed `redirectedToUrl` optional for
  Response types. Addresses
  [#9275](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9275).

**Dependency Updates**

- Upgraded Chrome browser version used during `cypress run` and when selecting
  Electron browser in `cypress open` from `85` to `87`. Addressed in
  [#9222](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/9222).
- Upgraded bundled Node.js version from `12.16.3` to `12.18.3`. Addressed in
  [#9222](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/9222).
- Upgraded `electron` from `10.1.5` to `11.0.2`. Addressed in
  [#9222](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/9222).
