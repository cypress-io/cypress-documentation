## 9.6.0

_Released 4/25/2022_

**Features:**

- Now you can easily test multi-domain workflows by using the experimental
  [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) command. This feature allows you to test
  across different origins or domains within a single test. This experiment was
  designed to work side-by-side with the [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session)
  experimental feature. You can turn on use of this command by setting the
  [`experimentalSessionAndOrigin`](/guides/references/experiments) configuration
  option to `true`. For more details, read
  [our blog post](https://cypress.io/blog/2022/04/25/cypress-9-6-0-easily-test-multi-domain-workflows-with-cy-origin/).
  Addressed [#17336](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17336) and
  [#944](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/944).
  - Added a new configuration option called `experimentalSessionAndOrigin`. This
    option enables support for [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) and
    [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin).
  - The `experimentalSessionSupport` configuration option has been removed and
    replaced by the `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` configuration option. Please
    update your configuration to use the new `experimentalSessionAndOrigin`
    option to continue to opt-in to this experimental feature.
  - When `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` is enabled, cross-origin requests will
    no longer immediately fail, but instead, time out based on the
    [`pageLoadTimeout`](/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts)
    configuration. This allows the request to be appropriately handled by the
    [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) command.
  - When `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` is enabled, Cypress will no longer wait
    on page loads between hooks before moving on to the next test.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue with Firefox 98+ where the Enter keystroke was not being sent
  to an input element when using [`.type('{enter}')`](/api/commands/type). Fixed
  [#21033](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21033).
- We now verify if an interruption while running tests was signaled by the user
  or if it came from an error in a plugin before showing the error message.
  Fixed [#21010](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21010).
- Improved the error message observed on Windows platforms when unzipping the
  Cypress binary and the max file length is exceeded. Fixed in
  [#21047](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21047).
- Updated the `Cypress.Commands.add()` TypeScript types to better reflect the
  attributes of the `.add()` utility and the JQuery element, a possible previous
  subject type. [#20376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20376).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` dependency from `15.3.5` to `15.5.1` to consume fixes
  related to
  [improve performance](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/33406) on
  macOS Big Sur and later. Addressed
  [#21068](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21068).
