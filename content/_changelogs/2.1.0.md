## 2.1.0

*Released 3/1/2018*

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent a bug with `node-sass` on OSX + Windows when local `node` version does not match bundled `node` when importing components directly in spec files. The underlying issue was because we forgot to update `Buildkite` and `Appveyor` when we upgraded `Electron` in `2.0.0`. Fixes [#1387](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1387) and [#1390](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1390).

**Features:**

- The [Selector Playground](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Selector-Playground) has been updated to automatically prefer `data-cy`, `data-test` or `data-testid` attributes when providing the unique selector for an element. Additionally it now exposes a [public API](/api/cypress-api/selector-playground-api) that you can use to control how it determines which selector to use. Fixes [#1135](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1135).
