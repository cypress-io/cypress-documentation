## 3.6.0

_Released 10/31/2019_

**Features:**

- [testFiles](/guides/references/configuration#Folders-Files) now also accepts an Array of glob patterns when specifying what test files to load in configuration. Addresses [#5401](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5401).

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in [#3.5.0](#3-5-0) where the maximum size of an HTTP header or body in a stubbed [cy.route()](/api/commands/route) was limited to 8kb causing requests to fail with a 431 HTTP error. Fixes [#5431](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5431).
- We fixed a bug where certain types of uncaught errors originating from the application under test would not route through the [uncaught:exception](/api/events/catalog-of-events#Uncaught-Exceptions) handler, and thus could not caught and ignored. These errors will also now correctly indicate that they came from application code. Fixes [#987](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/987).
- We fixed a regression in [#3.5.0](#3-5-0) that would throw an error during `cypress verify` when running as a non-root user on a non-Windows machine. We now always set the `--no-sandbox` flag when verifying in Electron, even when running as a non-root user. Fixes [#5434](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5434).
- We fixed a regression in [#3.5.0](#3-5-0) where sometimes cookies were not set on the correct URL during a redirect inside of a [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) or [cy.request()](/api/commands/request). Fixes [#5432](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5432).
- We fixed a regression in [#3.5.0](#3-5-0) causing environment variables containing unicode values to be incorrectly resolved when read via [Cypress.env()](/api/cypress-api/env). Fixes [#5435](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5435).
- We fixed a regression in [#3.5.0](#3-5-0) that prevented use of `.click()` or `.type()` inside of an iframe element. Fixes [#5449](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5449). Fixes [#5435](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5435).
- We now throw the proper error message when an element cannot be interacted with due to being covered by an element with `position:fixed`. Fixes [#5430](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5430).
- We fixed a regression in [#3.5.0](#3-5-0) that caused some `click` events to not be sent to the correct elements during `.click()`. Fixes [#5459](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5459).
- We updated `.type()` to properly respect focus selection changes during typing. Fixes [#5456](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5456).
- We fixed a regression in [#3.5.0](#3-5-0) that caused selected text to be overwritten while typing a modifer key during `.type()`. Fixes [#5439](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5439).
- We now send all the proper events during `.type()` to input elements with type `date`, `time`, and `datetime-local` so that it now behaves as it did prior to [#3.5.0](#3-5-0). Fixes [#5476](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5476).
- We now properly render iframe placeholder content when previewing DOM snapshots. Fixes [#5295](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5295).

**Misc:**

- We no longer log the default option `{multiple: true}` in the Command Log or the console during [cy.dblclick()](/api/commands/dblclick). Addresses [#5406](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5406).
- The text color of inactive tabs within the Cypress Chrome browser has been set to white for better readability. Addresses [#1661](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1661).

**Dependency Updates**

- Replaced `express-handlebars` with `squirrelly` to reduce dependency size. Addressed in [#5521](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/5521).
- Upgraded `graceful-fs` from `4.2.0` to `4.2.3`. Addressed in [#5497](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/5497).
