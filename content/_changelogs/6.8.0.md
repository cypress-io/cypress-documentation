## 6.8.0

_Released 3/17/2021_

**User Experience:**

- Improved the specs list user interface with a new icon set and accessibility features when in [Component Testing](/guides/component-testing/introduction) mode (alpha). Addressed in [#15513](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15513)

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress will no longer exit with an error when recording a run to the Dashboard with empty specfiles. Fixes [#15512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15512).
- When using `experimentalStudio`, [Cypress Studio](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-studio) the icon to add commands will now fully display on long test titles. Fixes [#15182](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15182).
