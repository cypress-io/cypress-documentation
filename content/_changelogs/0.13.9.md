## 0.13.9

*Released 01/28/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent regression with not automatically scaling the viewport to fit into the window size

**Misc:**

- Update links to match new [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io)
- [`.debug()`](/api/commands/debug) has been zipped up - it no longer logs confusing debugging information and now logs information about the previously run command.
- [`Cypress._`](/api/utilities/_), [`Cypress.$`](/api/utilities/$), [`Cypress.Promise`](/api/utilities/promise), [`Cypress.Blob`](/api/utilities/blob), [`Cypress.moment`](/api/utilities/moment) utilities have been moved off of `cy` and are now attached to `Cypress`. This is much more consistent with how the `cy` and `Cypress` APIs work. You can continue to use these objects off of `cy` but this has been deprecated and you will see a warning message.
