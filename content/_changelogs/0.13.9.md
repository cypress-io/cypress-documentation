## 0.13.9

_Released 01/28/2016_

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent regression with not automatically scaling the viewport to fit into the
  window size

**Misc:**

- Update links to match new [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io)
- [`.debug()`](/api/commands/debug) has been zipped up - it no longer logs
  confusing debugging information and now logs information about the previously
  run command.
- [`Cypress._`](/api/utilities/_), [`Cypress.$`](/api/utilities/$),
  [`Cypress.Promise`](/api/utilities/promise),
  [`Cypress.Blob`](/api/utilities/blob), `Cypress.moment` utilities have been
  moved off of `cy` and are now attached to `Cypress`. This is much more
  consistent with how the `cy` and `Cypress` APIs work. You can continue to use
  these objects off of `cy` but this has been deprecated and you will see a
  warning message.
