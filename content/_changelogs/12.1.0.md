## 12.1.0

_Released 12/12/2022_

**Features:**

- Added [`cy.getAllCookies()`](/api/commands/getallcookies) and
  [`cy.clearAllCookies()`](/api/commands/clearallcookies), which get and clear
  cookies for all browser cookies across any domains. Addresses
  [#24265](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24265),
  [#8956](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8956), and
  [#408](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/408).
- Updated the error messaging to provide more context when parallel group
  parameters are mismatched when sent to the Cypress Cloud. Fixes
  [#24734](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24734).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue with the `cy.session` command where it now recollects the
  session data after validation is successful to correctly store the full
  browser context before the command ends. Addressed with
  [#25112](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25112).
- Fixed an issue where recent versions of Firefox in headless mode would behave
  inconsistently with headed. Fixes
  [#24900](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24900).
- Fixed an issue where [`.select(index)`](/api/commands/select#Index) would fail
  when multiple `<option>` elements have the same value property. Fixes
  [#24739](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24739).
- Cleaned up temp files generated by `cypress run`. Addressed by
  [#24957](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24957)
- The Chrome web security configuration tooltip will now be shown only if
  [`chromeWebSecurity`](/guides/guides/web-security#Disabling-Web-Security) is
  set to false when using a non-chromium browser. Fixes
  [#23846](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23846).
- Fixed an issue where updating a component would not trigger the `supportFile`
  to reload imported stylesheets. This is fixed by doing a full reload for Vite,
  to ensure the spec re-runs correctly with the latest styles. Fixes
  [#24874](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24874).
- The
  [Run All Specs experiment](/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing)
  will now open in a new tab rather than close and reopen the browser. This will
  make the run faster and help mitigate
  [#21743](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21743). Fixes
  [#24919](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24919).
