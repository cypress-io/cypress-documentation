## 0.13.7

_Released 01/17/2016_

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent error during element stringification on `<svg>`. Fixes
  [#93](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/93).
- Clarified on errors related to not being able to run in CI. Previously there
  was a "catch all" error indicating your Cypress API Key was invalid. This was
  oftentimes incorrect. More specific errors have been added.
- [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) has been upgraded to handle current selection
  ranges. Previously if an `<input>` had a selection range as Cypress began to
  type, this would be ignored. Cypress now takes this into account and will type
  over any selected text (as native typing would do).

**Misc:**

- All Cypress related services have been updated to use HTTPS. We are forcing
  HTTPS redirects for everything except for `api.cypress.io`, which would be a
  breaking change. By the next minor release we will force that as well. Once we
  make this change we will remove all versions below `0.13.7`. So make sure you
  **are not** locking the Cypress version when running in CI. We periodically
  remove old Cypress versions which have security flaws and this is an example
  of one.
