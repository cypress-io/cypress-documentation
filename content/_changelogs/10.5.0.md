  [#23033](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23033).
- For Vue projects in component testing, choose to generate a spec file from a
  list of the components that exist in your project. Addresses

- If the user logs in to the Dashboard from the app, but the current project
  does not have a project ID, the user will now be able to enter the connect
  project workflow directly. Addresses
  [#23022](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23022)

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixes an issue where usage of the --spec option would result in no specs found
  if the absolute project path included glob pattern characters. Fixes
  [#22272](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22272).
- Webpack entry points are no longer preserved for CT Webpack projects. Fixes
  [#23224](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23224)
- Fixes an issue where session state was not being reset when changing between
  specs in open mode. Fixes
  [#23146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23146)
- Add delay to header tooltips so they don't pop open unless hovered on. Fixes
  [#23259](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23259)
- Fixed an edge-case bug where Cypress would hang in run-mode if an error was
  through from a test:before:run event handler. Fixes
  [#23039](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23039).
- Fixes an issue introduced in 10.3.0 where network logs could be missing
  certain information or cause certain requests to be delayed by 500ms. Fixes
  [#23227](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23227).
- In the 'Create Blank Spec' dialog, pressing enter or return when the focus is
  on the spec path input field will create the blank spec. Fixes
  [#21815](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21815).
- Fixes `lastMountedReactDom.unmountComponentAtNode is not a function` error
  when using React 18 mount. Fixes
  [#23081](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23081).
- Cypress will remember the spec filter in the 'Search Specs' field during your
  session and when a project is reopened. The same filter will be used in the
  main specs list as well as the inline specs list present in the Test Runner.
  Fixes [#21837](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21837).
- Fixed an issue that could lead to infinite recursion and thus a crash when
  running tests that make use of `cy.intercept`. Fixes
  [#22693](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/22693).
- In the Launchpad, the project's name will no longer link to the 'Choose
  Testing Type' step of the launchpad. This behavior was removed because in many
  situations it is not valid to go back to the testing type picker and in the
  situation where it is valid, there's already a 'Switch testing types' link on
  the same page. Fixes
  [#21911](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21911).
- CT projects using Vite v3 work with Node versions >=17. Fixes
  [#23042](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23042) &
  [#23114](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23114).

**Miscellaneous:**

- Updated UI styling for Cypress `about:blank` pages. Addresses
  [#20978](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20978).
- Stable Firefox versions 101 and 102 are now explicitly rendered as unsupported
  in Windows due to an unpatched browser incompatibility in those versions.
  Addresses [#23164](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23164).
- Add a useful warning for users on the old React API, cypress/react, who are
  using React 18. They can now take advantage of the React 18 integration,
  cypress/react18. Addresses
  [#23032](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23032).
- `cy.state('subject')` is deprecated and reading from it will log a warning to
  the console. Prefer `cy.currentSubject()` instead. Addresses
  [#23092](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23092).
