  organization that only has one project. Addresses

  `legacy` mode when `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` is set to true. Read more
  about
  [test isolation](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation)
  in Cypress to learn more. Addresses

- A list of Vue components in the project are now available for selection when
  generating a new spec for component testing in projects that are using the
  default spec pattern. Addresses
  [#22836](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22836).
- If the user logs in to the Dashboard from the app, but the current project
  does not have a project ID, the user will now be able to enter the connect
  project workflow directly. Addresses

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixes an issue where usage of the `--spec` option would result in no specs
  found if the absolute project path included glob pattern characters. Fixes
  [#22272](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22272).
- Webpack entry points are no longer preserved for CT Webpack projects. Fixes
  [#23224](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23224)
- Fixes an issue where session state was not being reset when changing between
  specs in open mode. Fixes
  [#23146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23146)
- Add delay to header tooltips so they don't pop open unless hovered on. Fixes
  [#23115](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23115)
- Fixed an edge-case bug where Cypress would hang in run-mode if an error was
  thrown from a `test:before:run` event handler. Fixes
  [#23039](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23039).
- Fixes an issue introduced in `10.3.0` where network logs could be missing
  certain information or cause certain requests to be delayed by 500ms. Fixes
  [#23227](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23227).
- In the 'Create Blank Spec' dialog, pressing enter or return when the focus is
  on the spec path input field will create the blank spec. Fixes
  [#21815](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21815).
- Fixes React 18 unmount component handling to resolve the  
  `lastMountedReactDom.unmountComponentAtNode is not a function` error. Fixes
  [#23081](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23081).
- Fixes a regression introduced in Cypress 10.0 where Cypress no longer
  persisted the spec filter in the 'Search Specs' field during a session and
  when a project is reopened. The same filter will be used in the main specs
  list as well as the inline specs list present in the Test Runner. Fixes
  [#21837](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21837).
- Fixed an issue that could lead to infinite recursion and thus a crash when
  running tests that make use of `cy.intercept()`. Fixes
  [#22693](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22693).
- In the Launchpad, the project's name will no longer link to the 'Choose
  Testing Type' step of the launchpad. Fixes
  [#21911](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21911).
- CT projects using Vite `v3` work with Node versions `>=17`. Fixes
  [#23042](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23042) &
  [#23114](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23114).

**Miscellaneous:**

- Updated UI styling for Cypress `about:blank` pages. Addresses
  [#20978](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20978).
- Stable Firefox versions 101 and 102 are now explicitly rendered as unsupported
  in Windows due to an unpatched browser incompatibility in those versions.
  Addresses [#23164](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23164).
- Add a warning for users on the old React API, `cypress/react`, who are using
  React 18. Users can now take advantage of the React 18 integration,
  `cypress/react18`. Addresses
  [#23032](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23032).
- `cy.state('subject')` is deprecated and reading from it will log a warning to
  the console. Prefer `cy.currentSubject()` instead. Addresses
  [#23092](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23092).
