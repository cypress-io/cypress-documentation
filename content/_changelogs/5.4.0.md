## 5.4.0

_Released 10/14/2020_

**Features:**

- You can now run [cypress cache prune](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-cache-prune) to delete all installed Cypress versions from the cache except for the currently-installed version. Addresses [#5972](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5972).
- There's a new `--size` option for the [cypress cache list](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-cache-list) command that prints the sizes of the Cypress cache folders. Addresses [#6404](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6404).
- For video recordings of runs, there is now a video chapter key for each test. If your video player supports chapters, you can move to the start of each test right away. Addresses [#3626](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3626).
- In Windows, you can now append the browser type to the end of the path passed to the `--browser` flag, like `cypress open --browser C:/User/App/browser.exe:chrome`, to help detect the browser type. Addresses [#6389](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6389).
- [cy.viewport()](/api/commands/viewport) has new `iphone-7`, `iphone-8`, and `iphone-se2` presets. Addressed in [#8624](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8624)
- When there is a new version of Cypress available, the update modal has a new design with 'copy to clipboard' buttons to copy the upgrade commands. Addressed in [#8751](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8751).
- The [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Command-Log) can be hidden by passing the `CYPRESS_NO_COMMAND_LOG=1` environment variable during `cypress open` or `cypress run` to be used as a tool to debug performance issues. Addressed in [#8689](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8689).

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in [5.8.0](#5-8-0) where the `chromeWebSecurity` option had no effect in Electron. Fixes [#8399](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8399).
- Tests will no longer hang and now properly throw when there is an error thrown from a `test:after:run` event listener. Fixes [#2271](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2271) and [#8701](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8701).
- When a command is chained after [.within()](/api/commands/within) and {% url "`cy.get()`" %} is called inside it, the scope will no longer permanently change. Fixes [#2106](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2106), [#4672](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4672), [#4757](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4757), and [#5183](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5183).
- Dual commands like [cy.contains()](/api/commands/contains) when used after an [.each()](/api/commands/each) commands now query as expected. Fixes [#4921](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4921).
- `/` is no longer added to the URL when `baseUrl` has param(s). Fixes [#2101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2101).
- When using [`cy.route2()`](http) the route handler timeouts will no longer leak into other tests and cause random failures. Addressed in [#8727](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8727).
- The `request.body` is now available when using [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait) on an aliased [`cy.route2()`](http) route which had not been intercepted. Fixes [#8695](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8695).
- Re-running failed build steps in Bitbucket will no longer create a new run on the Cypress Dashboard. Fixes [#8720](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8720).
- The forced garbage collection timer will no longer display when using a version of Firefox newer than 80. Fixes [#8725](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8725).
- The browser dropdown is no longer covered when opened from the Runs tab in the Test Runner. Fixed in [#8745](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8745).
- Fixed an issue where preprocessor-related plugins would cause tests not to run and a duplicate instance of Cypress to be spawned. Fixes [#8634](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8634).

**Misc:**

- Improved type definitions for [`cy.route2()`](http). Addresses [#8694](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8694) and [#8782](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8782).
- The Test Runner now shows an indicator in the footer and a toast notification if there is a new version available. Addressed in [#8702](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8702) and [#8803](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8803).
