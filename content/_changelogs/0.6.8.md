## 0.6.8

*Released 06/05/2015*

**Features:**

- [`cy.clearCookie()`](/api/commands/clearcookie) and [`cy.clearCookies()`](/api/commands/clearcookies) have been added as new commands.
- Cypress will automatically clear all cookies **before** each test run.
- Named the spec + app iframe so that inside of Chrome Dev Tools the iframe selector will clearly distinguish which iframe is your application versus Cypress.

**Bugfixes:**

- Hitbox is no longer covered up by element layers on DOM revert.
- Finally tracked down and fixed edge case causing empty view to display when tests were not empty. Fixes [#13](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/13)

**Misc:**

- [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) now accepts `{log: false}` to prevent logging out (useful in custom commands).
- [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) is now scoped by default to the `<body>` instead of `document` which prevents it from returning elements in the `head` like `title`.
