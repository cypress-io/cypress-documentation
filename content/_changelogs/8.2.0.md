## 8.2.0

_Released 08/03/2021_

**Features:**

- You can now cache and restore [cookies](/api/cypress-api/cookies),
  [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage),
  and
  [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
  in order to reduce test setup times by using
  [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session). The `session` API is experimental and
  can be enabled by setting the
  [`experimentalSessionSupport`](/guides/references/experiments) flag to `true`
  in your Cypress config. See
  [our blog](https://cypress.io/blog/2021/08/03/authenticate-faster-in-tests-cy-session-command/)
  and the [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) doc for more detail.
- The logging experience around HTTP requests has been updated.
  - `fetch` requests are always displayed in the Command Log, regardless of if
    `experimentalFetchSupport` is enabled.
  - Duplicate logs for XHRs, fetches, and `cy.intercept()` have been
    consolidated - Fixes
    [#14843](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14843).
- There's now a `Cypress.currentTest` property to access name the currently
  executing test via `Cypress.currentTest.title` and
  `Cypress.currentTest.titlePath`. Addresses
  [#2972](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2972).

**Bugfixes:**

- A "removing cookie failed" error will no longer throw when cookies are cleared
  in Firefox. Fixes [#6375](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6375).
- Cypress no longer throws the error "cannot read property split of undefined"
  in certain circumstances when application errors are thrown. Fixes
  [#17378](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17378).
- Cypress now properly runs the final test when nested in a suite with a
  `before` hook. Fixes
  [#9026](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9026).
- Fixed a regression in [8.0.0](/guides/references/changelog#8-0-0) where an
  error would longer throw when there is no `/etc/passwd` entry for the current
  user, such as in some Docker and GitHub Action setups. Fixes
  [#17415](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17415).
