## 5.1.0

*Released 9/1/2020*

**Features:**

- Introducing *experimental* full network stubbing support 🎉.
  - With `experimentalNetworkStubbing` enabled, the `cy.route2` command is available. Addressed in [#4176](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4176).
  - By using [`cy.route2()`](http), your tests can intercept, modify, and wait on any type of HTTP request originating from your app, including `XMLHttpRequest`s, `fetch` requests, beacons, and subresources (like iframes and scripts).
  - Outgoing HTTP requests can be modified before reaching the destination server, and the HTTP response can be intercepted as well before it reaches the browser.
  - See the [`cy.route2()`](http) docs for more information on how to enable this experiment.
- `cy.trigger()` now accepts an `eventConstructor` option for specifying the constructor with which to create the event to trigger. Addresses [#5650](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5650).
