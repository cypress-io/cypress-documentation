## 9.1.1

_Released 12/03/2021_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in [9.1.0](/guides/references/changelog#9-1-0) where our
  built binary didn't contain patches to some dependencies. Addressed in
  [#19239](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19239). This fixed some
  issues including:
  - A TypeError displaying `data.hasOwnProperty is not a function` will no
    longer throw in some situations. Fixes
    [#19091](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19091).
- When using the default configuration of `"nodeVersion": "system"` with an
  installed system node >=17, Cypress will now work properly rather than throw
  an error incorrectly pointing to the user's plugin file. Fixes
  [#18914](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18914).
- Shadow DOM elements no longer error as hidden during actionability when the
  element is covered by its parent shadow root. Fixes
  [#18008](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18008).
- When using `.type()` events now correctly propagate out of the shadow DOM.
  Fixes [#17531](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17531).
- The `this` context is now properly preserved when overwriting `cy.clock()`.
  Fixes [#19158](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19158).

**Dependencies:**

- Upgraded `@cypress/request` from `2.88.7` to `2.88.10`. Addressed in
  [#19099](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19099).
