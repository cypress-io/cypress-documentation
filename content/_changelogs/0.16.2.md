## 0.16.2

_Released 06/11/2016_

**Features:**

- Added new [`cy.screenshot()`](/api/commands/screenshot) command which can take
  screenshots on demand.
- When running `cypress run` or in CI, Cypress will now automatically take a
  screenshot when a test fails. You can optionally turn this off by setting
  [`screenshotOnHeadlessFailure`](/guides/references/configuration#Screenshots)
  to `false` in your configuration.
- Added new [`screenshotsFolder`](/guides/references/configuration#Screenshots)
  configuration option with default of `cypress/screenshots`.
- When running in [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/), we automatically export
  screenshots as artifacts which makes them available directly in their web UI.
  If you're using Circle CI, you'll be able to see screenshots without doing
  anything. If you're using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), you'll need to
  upload artifacts to an `s3 bucket`. This is a small slice of what is coming to
  help diagnose and understand errors in CI. Also in `0.17.0` we will
  automatically scroll the tests and more intelligently and open / close test
  commands so you can visually see what happened. Currently you may not see the
  test command's failure in the Command Log due to the view not scrolling.
- Added new [`.each()`](/api/commands/each) command which iterates serially on a
  collection yielding the iteratee, the index, and the collection. Addresses
  [#156](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/156).
- [`cy.route()`](/api/commands/route) can now accept a single function and/or
  you can pass a function to the `response` property. This allows you to lazily
  evaluate routing responses. Great for referencing fixtures. Addresses
  [#152](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/152).
- [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) now accepts a regular expression.
  Addresses [#158](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/158).
- [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) now accepts `{downarrow}` and `{uparrow}`. We
  do not move the caret but do fire all the proper events. Addresses
  [#157](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/157).

**Bugfixes:**

- [`cy.exec()`](/api/commands/exec) now outputs additional `stderr` and `stdout`
  information. It additionally will automatically `source` your `$SHELL` which
  makes GUI apps behave as if they've been launched from your terminal. Fixes
  [#153](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/153) and
  [#154](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/154).
- [`.then()`](/api/commands/then) yielding nested subjects.
- [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) no longer returns the last element
  found when siblings both contain the same content. Fixes
  [#158](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/158).
- Cypress no longer errors when you return a raw DOM element. It now correctly
  wraps this as the new subject.

**Misc:**

- [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) now provides an even more specific
  error message when it was scoped to a particular DOM element and contained a
  selector. Fixes [#160](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/160).
- You will now see a very specific error message when we detect that you've
  mixed up `async` and `sync` code in a [`.then()`](/api/commands/then) callback
  function. An example would be queuing up a new cypress command but then
  synchronously returning a different value.
