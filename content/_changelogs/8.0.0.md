## 8.0.0

_Released 07/19/2021_

**Summary:**

We've made some updates to ensure a consistent run experience across browsers.
Now all browsers run via `cypress run` run headlessly, with a device pixel ratio
of 1, and a screen size of 1280x720 by default.

**Breaking Changes:**

**<Icon name="exclamation-triangle" color="red"></Icon> Please read our
[Migration Guide](/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes
in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 8.0.**

- When running `cypress run` previous to 8.0, some browsers would launch headed
  while others were launched headless by default. Cypress now runs all browsers
  during `cypress run` as headless by default. Addresses
  [#16832](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16832).
- The default screen size when running a headless browser has been reverted back
  to 1280x720 pixels (pre 7.0 behavior). Addresses
  [#16853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16853).
- When running the `--headless` Chrome browser via `cypress run`, the device
  pixel ratio will now be 1 by default, matching the behavior of all other
  browsers. This behavior can be overridden through the
  [browser launch API](/api/plugins/browser-launch-api#Override-the-device-pixel-ratio).
  Addresses [#17375](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17375).
- Cypress now enforces version checks for browser launching and will error
  during `cypress run` and not allow opening the browser in `cypress open` when
  attempting to open unsupported browser versions. Cypress supports Chrome >=
  64, Firefox >= 86, and Edge >= 79. Addressed in
  [#17355](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/17355).
- Arguments returned from a chained function will no longer incorrectly be of
  type `jQuery` and instead have an `any` type. Fixes
  [#16669](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16669).
- The `Cypress.ConfigOptions`, `Cypress.ResolvedConfigOptions` and
  `Cypress.RuntimeConfigOption` types have been updated so that `ConfigOptions`
  match the JSON schema. Addressed in
  [#17251](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/17251).

**Features:**

- You can now configure certificate authority (CA) and client certificates to
  use within tests on a per-URL basis via a `clientCertificates` configuration
  option. See [Client certificates](/guides/references/client-certificates) for
  more detail.
- Setting the environment variable `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` now starts Cypress as
  a normal Node.js process rather than an Electron process. See
  [Running headless tests without Xvfb](/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Running-headless-tests-without-Xvfb)
  for more details. Addresses
  [#16505](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16505).

**Bugfixes:**

- `console.log` and `console.error` called within the
  [plugins file](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html#Plugin-files)
  will now be captured in the `stdout` sent to the Cypress Dashboard, making it
  visible in Output logs in the Dashboard. Fixes
  [#7434](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7434).
- There are several fixes for [`cy.intercept()`](/api/commands/intercept)
  including:
  - The `times` option now works correctly with `req.continue`. Fixes
    [#16821](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16821).
  - `localhost` is now accepted as a valid `hostname` in the `RouteMatcher`.
    Fixes [#17015](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17015).
  - `delay` now works correctly with a `statusCode` of 204. Fixes
    [#15188](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15188).
- When using the experimental
  [Cypress Studio](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-studio), there should be a
  reduced occurrence of "Studio failed to save commands" error messages. Fixes
  [#14767](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14767).
- [`cy.invoke()`](/api/commands/invoke) now retains the proper `this` context on
  nested object methods. Fixes
  [#3871](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3871).
- We no longer trigger unnecessary snapshot re-renders when hovering over the
  Command Log. Fixes
  [#17257](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17257).
