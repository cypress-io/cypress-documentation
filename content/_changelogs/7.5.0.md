_Released 06/07/2021_

**Features:**

- The Test Runner has a new 'Docs' menu with links and prompts specific to
  helping you get started writing tests, set up in CI, and running tests in the
  Dashboard. Addressed in
  [#16433](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/16433).
- `cy.request()` now accepts a generic in TypeScript for specifying the type of
  the request body. Addresses
  [#9109](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9109).

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress will not longer crash with a `hasBinary` infinite recursive call.
  Fixes [#16476](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16476).
- The `--config-file` option now correctly handles absolute paths. Fixes
  [#6136](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6136).
- `cy.location(<key>)` will now retry if the remote location returns an empty
  string, which is possible during otherwise harmless redirects. Fixes
  [#16463](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16463).
- Cypress now passes a flag to Chrome browsers to prevent update notifications
  from displaying in some cases. Fixes

  `<value>.should()` syntax. Fixes
