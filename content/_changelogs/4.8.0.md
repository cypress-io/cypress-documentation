## 4.8.0

_Released 6/8/2020_

**Features:**

- You can now apply certain
  [test configuration](/guides/references/configuration#Test-Configuration) for
  the duration of a suite or test by passing a configuration object to the test
  or suite as the second argument. Addresses
  [#7167](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7167).
- [Cypress.isBrowser()](/api/cypress-api/isbrowser) has been expanded to allow
  for new matcher arguments to assist in filtering matching browsers. Addresses
  [#7168](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7168).
- We now display the currently running file at the top of the Test Runner's
  Command Log.
  [That file can be opened](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Open-files-in-your-IDE)
  in your
  [preferred file opener](/guides/tooling/IDE-integration#File-Opener-Preference)
  by clicking the file. Addresses
  [#7506](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7506).
- We added experimental shadow DOM support through the
  [experimentalShadowDomSupport](/guides/references/experiments#Shadow-DOM)
  option. See the [Experiments page](/guides/references/experiments#Shadow-DOM)
  for more information. Addresses
  [#144](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/144).

**Bugfixes:**

- Upon domain navigation, `before` and `after` hooks defined in completed suites
  no longer erroneously rerun. Fixes
  [#1987](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1987).
- Errors thrown within root level `after` hooks now correctly display in the
  Test Runner's Command Log. Fixes
  [#2296](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2296).
- We fixed a regression in [4.6.0](#4-6-0) where an XHR response without a body
  would cause Cypress to throw `Cannot read property '__error' of null`. Fixes
  [#7518](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7518).
- We fixed a regression in [4.6.0](#4-6-0) where using
  [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) to an authenticated URL would error with
  `Request cannot be constructed from a URL that includes credentials: /__cypress/runner/./wasm/mappings.wasm`
  Fixes [#7481](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7481).
- We now properly load code from the `pluginsFile` or `supportFile` when they
  are TypeScript files. Fixes
  [#7459](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7459).
- utf-8 characters now properly display within error code frames. Fixes
  [#7507](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7507).
- Errors thrown in a
  [`cy.on('fail', fn)`](/api/events/catalog-of-events#Cypress-Events) fail
  handler now display a stack trace and code frame pointing to the origin of the
  error. Fixes [#7512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7512).
- [.click()](/api/commands/click) now properly clicks on wrapped inline elements
  when the first child element in the parent element has no width or height.
  Fixes [#7343](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7343) and
  [#7012](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7012).
- [cy.wrap()](/api/commands/wrap) now properly respects the `timeout` option. It
  also better handles situations when passed a promise that never resolves.
  Fixes [#5980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5980).
- When [experimentalSourceRewriting](/guides/references/experiments) is enabled,
  Cypress will no longer exit with SIGABRT in certain situations. Fixes
  [#7572](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7572).
- We fixed a regression in [3.8.0](#3-8-0) where the "Tests" button in the Test
  Runner wouldn't take you back to the tests list in all browsers. Fixes
  [#5948](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5948).
- Using the `S` shortcut during [.pause()](/api/commands/pause) no longer does
  anything. This prevents the Test Runner from getting into a 'stuck' state.
  Fixes [#6867](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6867).

**Misc:**

- The design of errors and some iconography displayed in the Test Runner's
  Command Log have been updated. Addresses

  [#7563](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7563).
- The commands in the Test Runner's Command Log now display in the same casing
  as the original command. Addresses
  [#5773](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5773).
- The navigation links in the Test Runner now display the correct CSS styles
  when focused. Addresses
  [#7491](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7491).

  `taskTimeout` option. Addresses

  [#7519](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7519).

  [#6979](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6979).
- We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript
  to JavaScript. Addresses
  [#2690](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2690) in
