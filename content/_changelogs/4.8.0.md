## 4.8.0

_Released 6/8/2020_

**Features:**

- You can now apply certain [test configuration](/guides/references/configuration#Test-Configuration) for the duration of a suite or test by passing a configuration object to the test or suite as the second argument. Addresses [#7167](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7167).
- [Cypress.isBrowser()](/api/cypress-api/isbrowser) has been expanded to allow for new matcher arguments to assist in filtering matching browsers. Addresses [#7168](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7168).
- We now display the currently running file at the top of the Test Runner's Command Log. [That file can be opened](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Open-files-in-your-IDE) in your [preferred file opener](/guides/tooling/IDE-integration#File-Opener-Preference) by clicking the file. Addresses [#7506](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7506).
- We added experimental shadow DOM support through the [experimentalShadowDomSupport](/guides/references/experiments#Shadow-DOM) option. See the [Experiments page](/guides/references/experiments#Shadow-DOM) for more information. Addresses [#144](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/144).

**Bugfixes:**

- Upon domain navigation, `before` and `after` hooks defined in completed suites no longer erroneously rerun. Fixes [#1987](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1987).
- Errors thrown within root level `after` hooks now correctly display in the Test Runner's Command Log. Fixes [#2296](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2296).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "4.6.0" changelog-4-6-0 %} where an XHR response without a body would cause Cypress to throw `Cannot read property '__error' of null`. Fixes [#7518](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7518).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "4.6.0" changelog-4-6-0 %} where using [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) to an authenticated URL would error with `Request cannot be constructed from a URL that includes credentials: /__cypress/runner/./wasm/mappings.wasm` Fixes [#7481](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7481).
- We now properly load code from the `pluginsFile` or `supportFile` when they are TypeScript files. Fixes [#7459](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7459).
- utf-8 characters now properly display within error code frames. Fixes [#7507](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7507).
- Errors thrown in a [`cy.on('fail', fn)`](/api/events/catalog-of-events#Cypress-Events) fail handler now display a stack trace and code frame pointing to the origin of the error. Fixes [#7512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7512).
- [.click()](/api/commands/click) now properly clicks on wrapped inline elements when the first child element in the parent element has no width or height. Fixes [#7343](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7343) and [#7012](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7012).
- [cy.wrap()](/api/commands/wrap) now properly respects the `timeout` option. It also better handles situations when passed a promise that never resolves. Fixes [#5980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5980).
- When [experimentalSourceRewriting](/guides/references/experiments) is enabled, Cypress will no longer exit with SIGABRT in certain situations. Fixes [#7572](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7572).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.8.0" changelog-3-8-0 %} where the "Tests" button in the Test Runner wouldn't take you back to the tests list in all browsers. Fixes [#5948](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5948).
- Using the `S` shortcut during [.pause()](/api/commands/pause) no longer does anything. This prevents the Test Runner from getting into a 'stuck' state. Fixes [#6867](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6867).

**Misc:**

- The design of errors and some iconography displayed in the Test Runner's Command Log have been updated. Addresses [#7499](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7499), [#7542](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7542) and [#7563](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7563).
