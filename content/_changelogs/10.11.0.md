_Released 10/25/2022_

**Features:**

- [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) is now supported when using
  [WebKit (Experimental)](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers#WebKit-Experimental)
  and `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` is enabled. Addresses
  [#24116](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24116),
  [#23832](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23832).
- Improves user experience when connecting a project to the Dashboard. Addresses
  [#23379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23379),
  [#23766](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23766),
  [#23767](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23767).
  - Users will be prompted to connect a project to the Dashboard when logging in
    from the Cypress Launchpad after a testing type has been selected.
  - Users will be prompted to record runs to the Dashboard from both the Cypress
    App and Cypress Launchpad if a project is connected to the Dashboard and has
    no recorded runs.

**Bugfixes:**

- When a chromium based browser tab or process crashes, Cypress will no longer
  hang indefinitely but will fail the current test and move on to the next.
  [#6170](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6170).
- Fixed as issue where browser-skipped tests were incorrectly recorded to the
  Dashboard which resulted in the Dashboard marking the test as "new" or
  "modified" when it already existed. Fixes
  [#23517](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23517).
- Fixed issue connecting to the cloud when a self-signed cert was in the cert
  chain. Fixes [#24298](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24298).
- [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) now supports more than 30 unique origin
  spec bridges per test. Fixes
  [#22874](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22874),
  [#23967](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23967).
- Fixed an issue where `document.cookie` would not reflect the correct value in
  cross-origin tests. Fixes
  [#23531](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23531).
- Cypress will now restart on changes to the `blockHosts` configuration entry.
  Fixes [#22634](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22634).
- When shown the command to record runs to the cloud, the user can select and
  copy parts of the command (like the record key), instead of only being able to
  use the "Copy" button to copy the entire command. Fixes
  [#22091](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22091).
- Cleaned up inconsistencies in the UI between sentence case and title case.
  Fixes [#21854](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21854).
- Fixed an issue where there is a visible "Project ID" section (with no
  `projectId`) when user has not connected to the Dashboard.
  [#21806](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21806).

**Experimental Breaking Changes:**

- [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin) now supports using `require()` and
  dynamic `import()` to include dependencies. `Cypress.require()` has been
  removed. Addresses
  [#24293](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24293).
- The way that Cypress handles
  [test isolation](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation)
  has changed. The previous modes of `legacy` and `strict` have been replaced
  with `on` and `off`. Fixes
  [#24206](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24206).
  - The default mode is `on` when
    [`experimentalSessionAndOrigin`](/guides/references/experiments) is enabled.
  - The [cy.session()](/api/commands/session) command now inherits the test
    isolation behavior for the suite it runs in.
