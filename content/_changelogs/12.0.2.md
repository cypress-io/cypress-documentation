## 12.0.2

_Released 12/08/2022_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in [12.0.0](#12-0-0) where
  [`.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) received multiple elements as a
  subject, it only searched inside the first one. Fixes
  [#25025](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25025)
- Fixed a regression in [12.0.0](#12-0-0) around
  [`.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) where if the subject was a `<form>`
  element, it would only consider the first `<input>` element in the form,
  rather than every child. Fixes
  [#25019](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25019)
