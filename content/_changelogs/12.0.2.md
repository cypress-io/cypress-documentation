## 12.0.2

_Released 12/08/2022_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in [12.0.0](#12-0-0), where when `.contains()` receives
  multiple elements as a subject, it only searched inside the first one. Fixes
  [#25025](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25025)
- Fixed a regression in [12.0.0](#12-0-0) around `.contains()` where if the
  subject was a `<form>` element, it would only consider the first `<input>`
  element in the form, rather than every child. Fixes
  [#25019](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25019)
- Limit the number of globals defined in memory due to the v8 snapshot. Fixed in
  [#25051](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25051)
