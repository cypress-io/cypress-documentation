**Features:**

  [`cy.origin()`](/api/commands/origin#Dependencies-Sharing-Code) docs for more
  information.
- Added support for re-using session data cached by
  [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) across specs via the
  `cacheAcrossSpecs` option. Addresses
  [#17710](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17710).

  can optionally modify the dev server config. Addresses
  [#23302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23302).

  and not just the file name. Fixes

  longer be displayed when using Webpack 5 and dynamic imports. Fixes

- The correct source control link is now sent to the Cypress Dashboard for
  failed specs when the cypress config file is not the project root. Fixes
