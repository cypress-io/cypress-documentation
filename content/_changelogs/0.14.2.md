## 0.14.2

_Released 03/14/2016_

**Bugfixes:**

- Chaining more cy commands after using [`cy.wrap()`](/api/commands/wrap) now works. Fixes [#114](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/114).
- Cypress now handles events property when a DOM element is removed during a `.click()` event. As per the spec, if `mousedown` causes element removal then `mouseup` and `click` and `focus` events will not be fired. Additionally if removal happens during `mouseup` then `click` event will not be fired. Also updated the `onConsole` groups to only display and indicate the events which actually fired. Fixes [#109](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/109).

**Misc:**

- Removed `fa-refresh` icons next to suites and tests until this behavior has been reimplemented due to ID removal.
- Removed resetting the runnable timeout when a `page load` event resolves. This prevents an edge case where the next test may show as timed out during `cypress run`.
