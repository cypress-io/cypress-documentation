- You can now click a 'Try Again' button to recheck if the server at the designated `baseUrl` is running within the warning message during `cypress open`. Addresses [#3284](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3284).
- There are "collapse all" and "expand all" links in the Test Runner's "Tests" tab to collapse or expand all folders within the "Integration Tests". Addresses [#6282](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6282).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in {% url "4.0.2" changelog-4-0-2 %} where Cypress could throw a "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error when transmitting a circular object over the internal WebSocket. Fixes [#6582](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6582).
- We fixed an issue where using Chromium-family browsers could cause Cypress to throw a "WebSocket is not open: readyState 3" error under certain conditions. Fixes [#5685](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5685).
- We now more thoroughly ensure the parent of an element exists when recursively calling visibility and existence checks in order to prevent some maximum call stack errors. Fixes [#4373](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4373).
- We fixed an issue where a maximum call stack error would throw in some circumstances when `xhr.onreadystatechange` is accessed. Fixes [#5864](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5864).
- We fixed a regression in {% url "3.5.0" changelog-3-5-0 %} where typing into an iframe with a body element with the contenteditable attribute would throw an error. Fixes [#5930](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5930).
- We now set the default window size when running Chrome headlessly to 1280x720. Fixes [#6210](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6210).
- We fixed an issue where `cypress install` would not complete on Node.js 8.0.0. Fixes [#6512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6512) and [#6568](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6568).
- [cy.clearLocalStorage()](/api/commands/clearlocalstorage) now properly accepts the `log` option to disable logging. Fixes [#6342](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6342).

**Misc:**

- The error messages displayed when rerouting to a non same-origin domain has been updated to more accurately reflect the rules around same-origin policy. Addresses [#6048](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6048).
- We fixed an error message that would display the wrong available browser families during validation. Addressed in [#6517](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/6517).
- We fixed some typos in some of our error messages. Addressed in [#6508](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/6508).
- We're collecting more environment variables when running Cypress with GitLab CI. Addresses [#6231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6231).

- We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript.
