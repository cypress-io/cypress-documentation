**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression in [4.0.2](#4-0-2) where Cypress could throw a "Maximum
  call stack size exceeded" error when transmitting a circular object over the
  internal WebSocket. Fixes
  [#6582](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6582).
- We fixed an issue where using Chromium-family browsers could cause Cypress to
  throw a "WebSocket is not open: readyState 3" error under certain conditions.
  Fixes [#5685](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5685).
- We now more thoroughly ensure the parent of an element exists when recursively
  calling visibility and existence checks in order to prevent some maximum call
  stack errors. Fixes
  [#4373](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4373).
- We fixed an issue where a maximum call stack error would throw in some
  circumstances when `xhr.onreadystatechange` is accessed. Fixes
  [#5864](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5864).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where typing into an iframe with a
  body element with the contenteditable attribute would throw an error. Fixes
  [#5930](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5930).
- We now set the default window size when running Chrome headlessly to 1280x720.
  Fixes [#6210](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6210).
- We fixed an issue where `cypress install` would not complete on Node.js 8.0.0.
  Fixes [#6512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6512) and
  [#6568](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6568).
- [cy.clearLocalStorage()](/api/commands/clearlocalstorage) now properly accepts
  the `log` option to disable logging. Fixes
  [#6342](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6342).

**Misc:**

- The error messages displayed when rerouting to a non same-origin domain has
  been updated to more accurately reflect the rules around same-origin policy.
  Addresses [#6048](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6048).

  families during validation. Addressed in

  [#6508](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/6508).

  CI. Addresses [#6231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6231).

  and `Cypress.$`. [More info here](/api/utilities/$#Cypress-vs-cy) Addresses
