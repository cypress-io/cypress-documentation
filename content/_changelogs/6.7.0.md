## 6.7.0

_Released 3/15/2021_

**Features:**

- The `experimentalRunEvents` configuration flag has been removed. You can now
  listen to `before:run`, `after:run`, `before:spec` and `after:spec` events in
  the plugins file without needing the
  [experimentalRunEvents](/guides/references/experiments) configuration option.
  See the [`before:run`](/api/plugins/before-run-api),
  [`after:run`](/api/plugins/after-run-api),
  [`before:spec`](/api/plugins/before-spec-api) and
  [`after:spec`](/api/plugins/after-spec-api) docs for more information.
  Addressed in [#15276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15276).
- When canceling a run from the Dashboard, previously only parallelized runs
  would cancel correctly. Now all recorded runs will respect cancelation and
  exit early. Addresses
  [#1691](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1691).
- [Test configuration](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Configuration)
  is now captured and sent when recording to the Dashboard. Addresses
  [#15487](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15487).
- Cypress now sends test details to the Dashboard at the beginning of a recorded
  run, so historical test code and other data can be provided to the Dashboard
  upfront. Addressed in
  [#14925](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14925).
- The full stack trace from errors thrown in the preprocessor are now displayed.
  Addressed in [#15198](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15198).
- Configuration values which are changed at runtime prior to tests running are
  now properly shown as resolved from the spec code within the Module API to
  indicate where the change originated from. Addresses
  [#15486](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15486).

**Bugfixes:**

- FFmpeg will no longer error ("width not divisible by 2") during video
  recording in Chromium-family browsers, including Chrome, Electron, and Edge.
  Fixes [#3491](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3491) and
  [#15300](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15300).
- [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait) no longer falsely returns a timeout when the
  user aborts an XHR. Fixes
  [#9549](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9549).
- [.clear()](/api/commands/clear) and
  [`.type('{selectall}{del}')`](/api/commands/type) now behave the same when
  they're used against elements that contain text inputs. Fixes
  [#8447](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8447).
- When using `experimentalStudio`,
  [Cypress Studio](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-studio) now records typing by
  using the value of the input rather than the keys that were pressed. Studio
  also no longer records pressing special keys (such as arrows or ctrl) except
  for Enter. Fixes [#15023](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15023).
- Empty jQuery objects are now properly shown in error messages in the Command
  Log. Fixes [#14279](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14279).
- Length assertions on DOM elements now properly show the user-defined assertion
  message if specified. Fixes
  [#14484](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14484).
- Cypress no longer scrolls on `mouse down` event, fixes
  [#8279](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8279).

**Misc:**

- We updated the UI when connecting a project to the Dashboard. Addressed in
  [#14877](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14877).
- "Test recordings" recorded to the Cypress Dashboard are now referred to as
  recorded "test results." Addresses
  [#15376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15376).
- Errors shown from the plugins file now display top-aligned. Addressed in
  [#15347](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15347).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` from `11.2.3` to `11.3.0`. Addressed in
  [#15201](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15201).
