## 6.7.0

_Released 3/15/2021_

**Features:**

- The `experimentalRunEvents` configuration flag has been removed. You can now listen to `before:run`, `after:run`, `before:spec` and `after:spec` events in the plugins file without needing the [experimentalRunEvents](/guides/references/experiments) configuration option. See the [before:run](/api/plugins/before-run-api), [after:run](/api/plugins/after-run-api), [before:spec](/api/plugins/before-spec-api) and [after:spec](/api/plugins/after-spec-api) docs for more information. Addressed in [#15276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15276).
- When canceling a run from the Dashboard, previously only parallelized runs would cancel correctly. Now all recorded runs will respect cancelation and exit early. Addresses [#1691](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1691).
- [Test configuration](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Configuration) is now captured and sent when recording to the Dashboard. Addresses [#15487](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15487).
- Cypress now sends test details to the Dashboard at the beginning of a recorded run, so historical test code and other data can be provided to the Dashboard upfront. Addressed in [#14925](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14925).
- The full stack trace from errors thrown in the preprocessor are now displayed. Addressed in [#15198](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15198).
- Configuration values which are changed at runtime prior to tests running are now properly shown as resolved from the spec code within the Module API to indicate where the change originated from. Addresses [#15486](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15486).

**Bugfixes:**

- FFmpeg will no longer error ("width not divisible by 2") during video recording in Chromium-family browsers, including Chrome, Electron, and Edge. Fixes [#3491](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3491) and [#15300](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15300).
- [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait) no longer falsely returns a timeout when the user aborts an XHR. Fixes [#9549](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9549).
- [.clear()](/api/commands/clear) and {% url "`.type('{selectall}{del}')`" type %} now behave the same when they're used against elements that contain text inputs. Fixes [#8447](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8447).
- When using `experimentalStudio`, [Cypress Studio](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-studio) now records typing by using the value of the input rather than the keys that were pressed. Studio also no longer records pressing special keys (such as arrows or ctrl) except for Enter. Fixes [#15023](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15023).
- Empty jQuery objects are now properly shown in error messages in the Command Log. Fixes [#14279](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14279).
- Length assertions on DOM elements now properly show the user-defined assertion message if specified. Fixes [#14484](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14484).

**Misc:**

- We updated the UI when connecting a project to the Dashboard. Addressed in [#14877](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14877).
- "Test recordings" recorded to the Cypress Dashboard are now referred to as recorded "test results." Addresses [#15376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15376).
- Errors shown from plugins files now display top-aligned. Addressed in [#15347](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15347).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` from `11.2.3` to `11.3.0`. Addressed in [#15201](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15201).
