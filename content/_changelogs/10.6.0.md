## 10.6.0

_Released 8/16/2022_

**Features:**

- Introduced a new Cypress experiment,
  [`experimentalSingleTabRunMode`](/guides/references/experiments), for
  Component Testing. When enabled, all specs will execute in a single tab,
  similar to the execution behavior observed in Component Testing alpha in
  Cypress 9, which can improve `run` mode performance, but can impact spec
  isolation and reliability on large test suites. Addresses
  [#22353](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22353).
- Enhanced the
  [`CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE`](/guides/references/advanced-installation#Environment-variables)
  environment variable interpolation to accept and replace `${version}` to allow
  version-specific download paths to be honored. Addresses
  [#5141](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5141),
  [#16976](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16976), and
  [#22864](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22864).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where the Firefox browser was not downloading files to the
  expected directory in Windows. Fixes
  [#17896](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17896).
- Fixed an issue in `cy.session()` where the unique session id logic was not
  persisting registered session ids, which incorrectly allowed session ids to
  override previously used session ids with different setups. Fixes
  [#22381](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22381).
- Fixed an issue where absolute path glob manipulation was incorrectly breaking
  `supportFile` and `specPattern` glob patterns that contained deep instances of
  the working directory. Fixes
  [#23361](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23361).
- Fixed an issue with the Specs list search that prevented full path matching.
  Fixes [#22463](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22463) and
  [#21879](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21879).
- Fixed an issue where Specs list popovers would not display a spec's full
  filename. Fixes [#23064](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23064).
