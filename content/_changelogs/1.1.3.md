## 1.1.3

_Released 12/3/2017_

**Bugfixes:**

- JSON fixtures with unicode escape sequences are now parsed correctly. Fixes [#964](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/964).
- The default `browserify` plugin no longer fires `watched:file:changed` twice leading to an uncaught exception that was popping up in the console. Also fixed a minor state bug in the `browserify` package. Fixes [#968](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/968).
- Cypress no longer reports `Electron` as the browser that ran in the Dashboard Service when a different browser was run. Fixes [#854](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/854).
- Invalid cookie values no longer crash Cypress. Fixes [#962](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/962).

**Misc:**

- We are now bundling our own `TypeScript` definitions with the `cypress` npm module. You no longer have to install `@types/cypress` anymore. We'll continue to keep these updated with API changes. Fixes [#856](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/856).
- Uncaught exceptions originating from **your** application code and/or test code are now **distinctly** and **clearly** indicated in the error message. We included a link to our docs to educate you on how you can optionally disable Cypress from catching these. Fixes [#825](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/825).
- [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) now accepts `{ failOnStatusCode: false }` which enables you to visit pages that respond with a non `2xx` status code. This brings it into parity with [cy.request()](/api/commands/request). Fixes [#421](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/421) and [#574](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/574).
- The contributing Readme's have been updated and improved for each package. Fixes [#995](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/995).
- Added utility methods [Cypress.platform](/api/cypress-api/platform) and [Cypress.arch](/api/cypress-api/arch) for returning the underlying OS information. Uses node's `os` module under the hood. Fixes [#824](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/824) and [#675](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/675).
