## 1.1.3

_Released 12/3/2017_

**Bugfixes:**

- JSON fixtures with unicode escape sequences are now parsed correctly. Fixes
  [#964](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/964).
- The default `browserify` plugin no longer fires `watched:file:changed` twice
  leading to an uncaught exception that was popping up in the console. Also
  fixed a minor state bug in the `browserify` package. Fixes
  [#968](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/968).
- Cypress no longer reports `Electron` as the browser that ran in the Dashboard
  Service when a different browser was run. Fixes
  [#854](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/854).
- Invalid cookie values no longer crash Cypress. Fixes
  [#962](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/962).

**Misc:**

- We are now bundling our own `TypeScript` definitions with the `cypress` npm
  module. You no longer have to install `@types/cypress` anymore. We'll continue
  to keep these updated with API changes. Fixes
  [#856](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/856).
- Uncaught exceptions originating from **your** application code and/or test
  code are now **distinctly** and **clearly** indicated in the error message. We
  included a link to our docs to educate you on how you can optionally disable
  Cypress from catching these. Fixes
  [#825](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/825).
- [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) now accepts `{ failOnStatusCode: false }`
  which enables you to visit pages that respond with a non `2xx` status code.
  This brings it into parity with [cy.request()](/api/commands/request). Fixes
  [#421](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/421) and
  [#574](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/574).
- The contributing Readme's have been updated and improved for each package.
  Fixes [#995](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/995).
- Added utility methods [Cypress.platform](/api/cypress-api/platform) and
  [Cypress.arch](/api/cypress-api/arch) for returning the underlying OS
  information. Uses node's `os` module under the hood. Fixes
  [#824](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/824) and
  [#675](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/675).
