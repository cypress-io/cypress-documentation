## 0.6.12

_Released 06/09/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- When Cypress detects a `page loading` event it will now clear out the subject
  so the next commands cannot reference previous page DOM elements.
- [`.check()`](/api/commands/check) and [`.uncheck()`](/api/commands/uncheck)
  will no longer output additional error'd commands when their associated
  `click` fails.

**Misc:**

- [`.type()`](/api/commands/type), [`.clear()`](/api/commands/clear),
  [`.check()`](/api/commands/check), [`.uncheck()`](/api/commands/uncheck) now
  all take `{force: true}` options to force the click to happen and skip
  additional clickable checks.
- Now when you click the giant yellow failure messages if the error is a
  `CypressError` instead of logging nothing it will now find the command
  associated to that error and display the same message as if you clicked the
  failed command.
