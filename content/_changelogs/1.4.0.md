## 1.4.0

_Released 12/19/2017_

**Features:**

- There is now a Search Bar in the Desktop GUI that enables you to filter the
  list of specs. Helpful for projects with a ton of spec files. Fixes
  [#1098](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1098).

**Bugfixes:**

- The seeded `example_spec.js` file no longer fails in Windows on the
  [cy.exec()](/api/commands/exec) test. It now conditionally runs a command
  appropriate for Windows. Fixes
  [#1097](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1097).
- Trying to log in to Cypress no longer causes the app to crash. This area has
  had many more tests added. Fixes
  [#1093](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1093).
- Some minor improvements to TypeScript definitions around
  [.then()](/api/commands/then). Fixes
  [#1084](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1084).
- The Selector Playground now works correctly in the Electron browser. Fixes
  [#1086](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1086).
