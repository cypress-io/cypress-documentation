## 9.3.0

_Released 1/18/2022_

**Features:**

- Added a new Cypress command, called
  [`.selectFile()`](../api/commands/selectfile.md), to select a file or files in an
  HTML5 input element or simulate dragging a file or files into the browser. The
  API is similar to `cypress-file-upload` and we have provided a
  [migration guide](../guides/references/migration-guide#Migrating-from-cypress-file-upload-to-selectFile)
  for previous users of that plugin. For more details, see
  [our blog post](https://cypress.io/blog/2022/01/18/uploading-files-with-selectfile/).
  Fixes [#19524](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19524) and
  [#170](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/170).
- Exposed the `Buffer` polyfill, as [`Cypress.Buffer`](../api/utilities/buffer),
  to enable working with binary data. Addressed in
  [#19524](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19524).
- Added the `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE` environment variable which can be
  set to a string template for building the download URL for the Cypress binary.
  This environment variable is useful for users who are downloading the Cypress
  binary from a proxy that is not one-to-one with the Cypress's default download
  url. More information can be found in the
  [Install Binary](../guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Install-binary)
  documentation. Fixes
  [#15697](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15697).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue where the `--spec` CLI parameter was not working properly when
  passing multiple glob patterns that are separated by commas. Fixes
  [#16102](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16102).
- Fixed an issue with how the `CYPRESS_VERIFY_TIMEOUT` environment variable was
  read so it can set in a project's `package.json` or it's `.npmrc`. Fixes
  [#19559](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19559).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `graceful-fs` from `4.2.0` to `4.2.9`. This upgrade resolves issues
  observed with using graceful-fs v4.2.0 with resolve v1.21+. Addressed in
  [#19676](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19676) and resolves
  [#19610](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19610).
  - **NOTE:** This upgrade to `graceful-fs` breaks Cypress's compatibility with
    Yarn 2. We have observed errors with Yarn 2.4.2 with `graceful-fs` 4.2.9.
    Before this change, Cypress had minimal Yarn 2 support (see
    [#6377](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6377)). Between Yarn 3
    fixing multiple bugs and the migration path from Yarn 2 to Yarn 3 being
    minimal, we felt the best step forward was to support and recommend Yarn 3
    over Yarn 2.
- Upgraded `electron` from `15.2.0` to `15.3.4`. Addressed in
  [#19351](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19351).
