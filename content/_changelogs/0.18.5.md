## 0.18.5

*Released 01/08/2017*

**Features:**

- You can now disable `videoCompression` by passing `false` in `cypress.json` or env variables. In very long runs and on CPU throttled instances compression can take a considerable amount of time, possibly as much as 50% of the time spent running actual tests. Fixes [#372](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/372).

**Misc:**

- Improved performance when running `cypress run` by caching the last bundled spec. This prevents having the same spec file rebundled each time [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) caused a full page navigation. You should see a moderate improvement in test run time. Fixes [#370](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/370).
- We are now capturing `stdout` and several other properties for use + display in our Dashboard on `cypress ci` runs.
- Enable [`cy.fixture()`](/api/commands/fixture) to send an encoding for images other than forcing the default encoding of `base64`. Fixes [#373](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/373).
- Enable [`cy.route()`](/api/commands/route) to pass an `encoding` parameter when using `fx:fixture` syntax. Fixes [#374](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/374).
