## 0.11.4

_Released 09/17/2015_

**Features:**

- [`.should()`](/api/commands/should) now accepts a callback function which will
  be retried until it does not throw. The callback function will be retried in
  the exact same way as passing regular string-based chainers to
  [`.should()`](/api/commands/should). Having a callback function gives you an
  opportunity to _massage_ the expected subject such as comparing multiple
  elements, creating an array of text or classes, etc.

**Deprecations:**

- `cy.wait(function)` has been deprecated and you can safely rename this command
  to [`.should()`](/api/commands/should).

**Misc:**

- All of the docs surrounding
  [assertions](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Assertions),
  [`.should()`](/api/commands/should), and [`.and()`](/api/commands/and) have
  been updated to reflect the new API.
