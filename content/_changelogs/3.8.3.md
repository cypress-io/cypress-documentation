## 3.8.3

_Released 1/24/2020_

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed an error during `cypress run` indicating `could not find CRI target`
  when Cypress was unable to find the tab to control. Fixes
  [#6053](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6053).
- HTTP requests to sites using a TLS version lower than 1.2 now no longer fail.
  Fixes [#5446](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5446).
- `cypress verify` will no longer error on some systems when `-screen` is not
  defined. Fixes [#6184](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6184).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) causing
  [`cy.type({ force: true })`](/api/commands/type) to no longer forcibly type
  characters for readonly inputs. Fixes
  [#6116](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6116).
- Generated reports when using [custom reporters](/guides/tooling/reporters) now
  have a defined `file` property. Fixes
  [#1495](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1495).

**Misc:**

- Messages from [cy.get()](/api/commands/get) are now truncated at 50 lines the
  Command Log instead of the 1 line. Addresses
  [#6145](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6145).
- We now collect more environment variables for Bamboo CI when recording for the
  Dashboard. Addresses
  [#4895](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4895).
