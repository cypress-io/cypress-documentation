## 0.16.4

*Released 06/17/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed regression caused by `0.16.2` where a failed [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) would not be canceled and would continue to run and display failed assertions in between test runs (without a full page refresh). Fixes [#174](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/174).
