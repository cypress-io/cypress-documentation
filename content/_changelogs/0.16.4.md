## 0.16.4

_Released 06/17/2016_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed regression caused by `0.16.2` where a failed
  [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) would not be canceled and would
  continue to run and display failed assertions in between test runs (without a
  full page refresh). Fixes
  [#174](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/174).
