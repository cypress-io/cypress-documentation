## 0.11.6

_Released 09/25/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- Viewport is now properly restored to the default width / height on subsequent
  runs. Previously it would retain the last viewport size used until there was a
  new viewport command.
- [`cy.should('contain', '...')`](/api/commands/should) now correctly escapes
  quotes and single quotes.
- Assertion messages are no longer truncated, and instead will scale down by
  reducing the `font-size` and `line-height` after they exceed 110 characters.
  So you'll now always see the full assertion message.
- Fixed some scenarios where assertions would not be logged as a child command.
- Assertions based around the `window` or `document` object no longer cause Chai
  to bomb on formatting their object structures (due to cylic references) and
  instead now will show up as `<window>` and `<document>`.

**Misc:**

- [`cy.window()`](/api/commands/window) now logs out to the `Command Log` and
  additionally verifies upcoming assertions.
- [`cy.document()`](/api/commands/document) now logs out to the `Command Log`
  and additionally verifies upcoming assertions.
- Removed `numElements` label on assertions which indicated the number of
  elements found if > 1. This was annoying and redundant since the inked command
  already had this number.
