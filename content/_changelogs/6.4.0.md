## 6.4.0

*Released 2/1/2021*

**Features:**

- There's now a [Command Log](/guides/core-concepts/test-runner#Command-Log) entry in the Test Runner for when a file is downloaded. Addresses [#14749](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14749).

**Deprecations:**

- The `delayMs` option for [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) has been renamed to `delay`. `delayMs` will still work, but it is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Addresses [#14822](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14822).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue causing a webpack compilation error when a `browserslist` is present in project root. Addresses [#8864](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8864).
- Fixed an issue with [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) where aliases set via `req.alias` containing a period character would not work as expected. Addresses [#14444](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14444).
- Fixed an issue where delays set using [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) would not work as expected. Addresses [#14446](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14446).
- Reverted a change to how the Chrome DevTools Protocol is established. Instead of using stdio and then falling back to TCP, Cypress now only uses TCP to try to connect to Chrome DevTools Protocol. Addresses [#14819](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14819).
- We now better handle spec paths containing special characters so they properly show in the code frame and work when interacting via your IDE. Addresses [#14659](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14659).
- We addressed several issues with the experimental [Cypress Studio](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-studio). To enable the Cypress Studio you can set `experimentalStudio` to `true` in your Cypress configuration. Issues addressed:
  - Cypress Studio now prompts to start adding commands after visiting an inputted url. Addresses [#14688](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14688).
  - Empty `.type()` commands will no longer be generated when tabbing through inputs. Addresses [#14684](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14684).
  - Cypress Studio no longer prompt to enter a URL if the test is in an errored state. Addresses [#14686](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14686).
  - Cypress Studio now reloads tests when `watchForFileChanges` is `false`. Addresses [#14744](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14744).
  - An empty `.click()` command will no longer be added before `.type()` in Cypress Studio when it is followed by typed characters. Addresses [#14685](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14685).
  - Cypress Studio will now use the correct selector for an element even if the click event changed the selectors. Addresses [#14658](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14658).
  - Multi-select `selects` are now supported in Cypress Studio. Addresses [#14743](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14743).
  - There's an improved UI for command failures within Cypress Studio. Addresses [#14691](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14691).
  - The Selector Playground is now closed automatically when Cypress Studio is opened. [#14689](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14689).

**Misc:**

- The "no specs found" error now displays which directory it searched for specs. Addresses [#14532](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14532).
- More types for the resolved config property have been added. Addresses [#14392](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14392).
