## 0.18.3

_Released 12/18/2016_

**Features:**

- There is now a [`cy.log()`](/api/commands/log) command for displaying an
  arbitrary message and args. Useful for providing context while testing and
  debugging long tests. Fixes
  [#342](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/342).

**Bugfixes:**

- [`cy.title()`](/api/commands/title) now uses the `document.title` property as
  opposed to querying for `<title>` elements in the `<head>`. Fixes
  [#351](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/351) and
  [#331](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/331).
- We now exit correctly (with status of 1) in the case of headless renderer
  crashes. Additionally we capture these errors properly, explain what happened,
  and link to external error document to suggest fixes. Fixes
  [#270](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/270) and
  [#348](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/348).

**Misc:**

- Improved headless performance, and added optimizations for early and often GC.
