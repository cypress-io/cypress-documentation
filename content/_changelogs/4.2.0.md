  Fixes [#6669](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6669).

  when running the plugins file process. Fixes
  [#6570](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6570).
- We now more thoroughly ensure the parent of an element exists when recursively
  calling actionability checks in order to prevent some maximum call stack
  errors. Fixes [#6707](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6707).

  erroring. Fixes [#4210](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4210).

  not minified. Fixes
  [#1436](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1436).

  `cypress open` when there was an exception if thrown in an `after` hook. Fixes
  [#6619](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6619).
- [cypress verify](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-verify) no longer
  incorrectly prints messaging about this being the first time using that
  Cypress version. Fixes
  [#6607](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6607).

  are enabled. Fixes [#6662](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6662).
