## 3.3.0

*Released 5/17/2019*

**News:**

- We've [written a blog post](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/05/22/how-we-improved-network-speed-by-300-in-cypress-3-3-0/) about the 300% increase in proxy performance delivered in `3.3.0`.

**Features:**

- Cypress now automatically reads from your system's `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables and proxies traffic accordingly through Cypress based on these values. This includes network traffic within your application under test, when downloading Cypress, and when accessing 'Runs' within the Test Runner. Please read our new [Proxy Configuration](/guides/references/proxy-configuration) doc to understand more about proxy configuration in Cypress. Fixes [#672](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/672), [#733](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/733), [#939](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/939), [#1039](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1039), [#1459](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1459), [#1469](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1469), [#1470](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1470), [#1541](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1541), [#1608](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1608), [#2295](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2295), [#3855](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3855), [#3865](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3865), [#1401](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1401) and [#3857](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3857).
- Your project's current proxy settings now display in the [Settings of the Test Runner](/guides/references/proxy-configuration#View-proxy-settings-in-Cypress). Addresses [#3856](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3856).
- Support for `have.focus`, `not.have.focus`, `be.focused` and `not.be.focused` [assertions](/guides/references/assertions) have been added. Addresses [#97](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/97).
- We now offer a separate 32bit and 64bit build for Windows. Addresses [#716](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/716), [#787](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/787), [#2095](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2095), [#706](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/706), [#3706](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3706), and [#4016](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4016).
- Requests that go through [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) or [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) are now automatically retried under the hood when the request fails. This more closely reflects Chrome's default behavior on requests. Addresses [#4013](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4013), [#898](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/898) and [#1013](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1013).
- [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) and [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) now support new options `retryOnStatusCodeFailure` and `retryOnNetworkFailure` to allow changing Cypress's automatic request retry on status codes and network errors. Addresses [#4013](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4013), [#898](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/898) and [#1013](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1013).
- [.type()](/api/commands/type) now supports the special character sequences `{insert}`, `{pageup}`, and `{pagedown}`. Addresses [#3845](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3845).
- We now indicate which XHRs match which alias in the Command Log on [.wait()](/api/commands/wait) when they match an alias multiple times. Addresses [#477](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/477).
- The console log when clicking on the [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) command now displays its resolved `options` arguments. Addresses [#3721](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3721).
- There's a new 'canceled' XHR status shown on the Command Log to indicate the difference between calling `xhr.abort()` and the browser canceling the request due to page navigation. Addresses [#3973](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3973).
- The Electron browser now runs Chrome Version 61. Addresses [#4000](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4000).
- Running Cypress via `cypress run` now supports scripts of `type="module"`. Fixes [#3696](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3696).
- Exposed [Cypress.isCy()](/api/cypress-api/iscy) method to check if a value is a valid instance of `cy` or a `cy` chainable. Fixes [#3822](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3822).
- There is a new "Download Chromium" menu item in the "Help" menu of the Test Runner links to Cypress's [Chromium Download Tool](https://on.cypress.io/chromium-downloads). Addresses [#3977](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3977)

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression introduced in [3.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0) that caused an error to throw when visiting domains with certain public suffixes. Fixes [#3717](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3717).
- When running Cypress with `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variables set, Cypress no longer issues an incorrect 0 exit code. [#1676](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1676)
- Fixed a regression introduced in [3.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0) that caused [.its()](/api/commands/its) to no longer retry when it yields `undefined`. [#3837](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3837)
- Fixed a regression introduced in [3.2.0](/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0) that caused [cy.fixture()](/api/commands/fixture) to throw a `EISDIR` error if a directory had the same name as a file within that same directory. Fixes [#3739](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3739).
- `user-agent` headers sent as arguments to [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) and [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) are now properly sent. Fixes [#3873](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3873) and [#3719](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3719).
- When a request is proxied through Cypress and there is a network error, we no longer send an HTML response with a 500 status code. We now  kill the browser-facing socket and let the network error be handled by the application under test. Fixes [#4101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4101), [#4231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4231), [#1036](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1036), [#4231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4231), and [#1398](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1398).
- We changed Cypress's implementation to no longer rely on internal XHR events when the browser navigates. This fixes a a bug in Chrome 71+ that could cause XHRs to pend forever. Fixes [#3973](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3973) and [#4130](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4130)
- We greatly improved the speed of proxied requests through our network layer. Fixes [#3192](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3192) and [#1469](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1469).
- If an error occurs during `cypress verify`, we now kill the verification process after 10 seconds and print the error message. This should prevent some situations where Cypress would hang during installation or verification and never exit. Fixes [#819](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/819).
- Cypress automatically retries `cypress verify` and `cypress run` commands by starting its own Xvfb server on Linux if the first attempt fails due to possible `DISPLAY` misconfiguration. Addresses [#4034](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4034).
- Cypress now properly handles typing JavaScript object prototype methods (like `hasOwnProperty`) into [`.type()`](/api/commands/type). Fixes [#3423](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3423).
- We now set the `form` option to `true` if the `Content-Type` header equals `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `json` is not already set by a user. This fixes a situation where Cypress would try to parse the `body` as a string, resulting in a confusing error message. Fixes [#2923](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2923).
- [cy.contains()](/api/commands/contains) now correctly handles comma delimited arguments passed to the selector argument.  Fixes [#2407](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2407).
- Passing a browser path containing spaces now works properly when passed to the `--browser` argument. Fixes [#3979](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3979)
- Fixed display of tooltips when selecting elements from the Selector Playground so that they display at the correct coordinates when scrolling. Fixes [#1351](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1351).
- The lists of spec files now display at the correct indentation level when they are nested more than 5 directories deep. Fixes [#3652](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3652).
- Cypress now properly parses environment variables with empty values. Fixes [#3742](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3742).
- Assertions running outside of a test are now properly handled in Cypress instead of throwing internal errors. Fixes [#3926](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3926).
- [Cypress.log()](/api/cypress-api/cypress-log) now throws an error when not properly passed an object as its argument. Addresses [#3658](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3658).
- [Cypress.log()](/api/cypress-api/cypress-log) no longer throws when called before any other Cypress commands. Fixes [#3658](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3658).

**Misc:**

- We now better support capturing environment variables within Azure DevOps. Addresses [#3657](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3657).
- Cypress now only scans for spec changes when the watcher sees changes, rather than polling to scan. Addresses [#3069](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3069).
- The ability to open the context menu to see "Inspect Element" has been reenabled in the Electron browser. Addresses [#4002](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4002).
- We no longer package non-Windows FFmpeg builds with Windows builds, resulting in a 35-40% reduction in zipped size and a 36-43% reduction in unzipped size of download. Addresses [#3888](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3888).
- The warning messages when going over test recording limits have been updated to correctly display 'monthly tests' and 'private tests' where necessary. Addresses [#4024](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4024).
- When an HTTP request is received by the proxy layer, by default, we send it with a `Connection: keep-alive` header so that the connection will be reused if possible. Addresses [#3857](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3857).
- Improved accessibility of Test Runner for screen readers. Addresses [#3850](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3850).
- Cypress type definition now allow a `timeout` option in [cy.hash()](/api/commands/hash). Fixes [#3844](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3844).
- Fixed type definition for `match` assertion so that it now only accepts `RegExp` type arguments. Fixes [#2578](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2578).
- The [.trigger()](/api/commands/trigger) type definition now expects its `options` to be `ObjectLike`. Addressed in [#3809](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3809).
- The [cy.clock()](/api/commands/clock) type definition now allows for type `Date`. Fixed in [#4106](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4106).
- Added type definition for undocumented `Cypress.LocalStorage.clear` method. Fixes [#4070](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4070).
- Added type definition for [Cypress.isCy()](/api/cypress-api/iscy) method. Fixes [#3822](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3822).
- Added missing type definitions for some [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) options. Fixes [#3989](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3989).
- The spinner animation should more smoothly spin when a command is pending in the Test Runner. Addressed in [#4005](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4005).
