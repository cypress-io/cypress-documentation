## 0.7.5

_Released 06/19/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- [`.click()`](/api/commands/click) now takes into account being covered by a fixed positioned element and will increase the window's scroll offset to account for this. There are still more improvements to be made before this is bulletproof though.
- [`cy.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) could potentially resolve to a null subject if the matching content was split across multiple nested children elements. This has been fixed and contains will now return the first, deepest element which contains text potentially spread over multiple text nodes and/or children elements.
