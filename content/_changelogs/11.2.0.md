## 11.2.0

_Released 11/22/2022_

**Features:**

- Adds a new experimental flag, `experimentalRunAllSpecs`, for running multiple
  tests sequentially in Open Mode for End to End testing. Addresses
  [#24168](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24168) and
  [this discussion](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21628)
- Added messaging in CI in run mode to direct people to set up recording to the
  dashboard on failures if they are not already set up to do so. Addresses
  [#24000](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24000)
- Visually warn in the Command Log when `cy.session()` fails to restore a session
  to surface to users potential issues with their setup and validation.
  Addresses [#24207](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24207)

**Bugfixes:**

- The cy.session() command no longer clears the page between setup and validation and
  will now always clear the page at the end of the command when test isolation
  is on. Fixes [#21397](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21397)
