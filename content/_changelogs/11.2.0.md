## 11.2.0

_Released 11/22/2022_

**Features:**

- Re-implemented the 'Run All Specs' for End to End Testing for running multiple
  tests sequentially in open mode. This feature had been previously removed in
  Cypress 10.0. Enable 'Run All Specs' with the new experimental flag,
  `experimentalRunAllSpecs`. Please leave any feedback around 'Run All Specs'
  [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21628). Your feedback
  will help us make product decisions around the future of this feature.
  Addresses [#24168](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24168)
- Added messaging in CI to direct people to set up recording to the Cypress
  Cloud on failures if they are not already set up to do so. Addresses
  [#24000](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24000)
- Visually warn in the Command Log when `cy.session()` fails to restore a
  session to surface to users potential issues with their setup and validation.
  Addresses [#24207](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24207)

**Bugfixes:**

- The cy.session() command no longer clears the page between setup and
  validation and will now always clear the page at the end of the command when
  test isolation is on. Fixes
