## 11.2.0

_Released 2022-11-22_

**Features:**

- Re-implemented the 'Run All Specs' for End to End Testing for running multiple
  tests sequentially in open mode. This feature had been previously removed in
  Cypress 10.0. Enable 'Run All Specs' with the new experimental flag,
  [`experimentalRunAllSpecs`](guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing).
  Please leave any feedback around 'Run All Specs'
  [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21628). Your feedback
  will help us make product decisions around the future of this feature.
  Addresses [#24168](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24168)
- Added messaging after failures in CI to direct people to set up recording to
  the Cypress Cloud if they are not already set up to do so. Addresses
  [#24000](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24000).
- Visually warn in the Command Log when the
  [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) command fails to restore a session to
  surface to users potential issues with their setup and validation. Addresses
  [#24207](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24207).

**Bugfixes:**

- The [`cy.session()`](/api/commands/session) command no longer clears the page
  between setup and validation and will now always clear the page at the end of
  the command when test isolation is on. Fixes
  [#21397](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21397).
