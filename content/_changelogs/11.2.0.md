## 11.2.0

_Released 11/21/2022_

**Features:**

- Added messaging to direct people to set up recording to the dashboard on
  failures if they are not already set up to do so. Addresses
  [#24000](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24000)
- Visually warn in the Command Log when cy.session() fails to restore a session
  to surface to users potential issues with their setup and validation.
  Addresses [#24207](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24207)

**Bugfixes:**

- The session command no longer clears the page between setup and validation and
  will now always clear the page at the end of the command when test isolation
  is on. Fixes [#21397](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21397)
