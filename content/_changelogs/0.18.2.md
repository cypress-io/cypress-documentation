## 0.18.2

*Released 12/15/2016*

**Bugfixes:**

- Under the hood [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) now sets an `Accept: text/html,*/*` request header to prevent some web servers from sending back `404` in the case where they required this header. Only a small % of servers would ever do this, but `webpack-dev-server` was one of them. Fixes [#309](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/309).
- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) now sends an `Accept: */*` request header by default too. Fixes [#338](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/338).

**Misc:**

- [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) now includes more debugging information (related to headers) in the error output. Fixes [#341](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/341).
- When [`cy.request()`](/api/commands/request) times out, we now output much better error messages including information about the request sent. Fixes [#340](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/340).
