## 0.11.2

_Released 2015-09-14_

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevented bug where the assertion message: `expected <x> element to exist`
  would log over and over again when Cypress retried querying for a DOM element.

**Misc:**

- [`.root()`](/api/commands/root) now outputs its subject when clicking on its
  command log. Fixes [#55](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/55).
