## 6.2.0

_Released 12/21/2020_

**Features:**

- You can now listen to `before:run`, `after:run`, `before:spec` and `after:spec` events in the plugins file when setting the [experimentalRunEvents](/guides/references/experiments) configuration option to `true`. See the [before:run](/api/plugins/before-run-api), [after:run](/api/plugins/after-run-api), [before:spec](/api/plugins/before-spec-api) and [after:spec](/api/plugins/after-spec-api) docs for more information. Addressed in [#9646](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9646), [#14178](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14178) [#14238](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14238) and [#14263](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14263).
- The `Timed out retrying` error message now displays the amount of time Cypress retried. Addresses [#5781](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5781).
- The RouteMatcher argument for [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) has a new `matchUrlAgainstPath` property. When set to `true`, Cypress will match the supplied `url` against incoming `path`s. Addressed in [#14241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14241).

**Bugfixes:**

- Passing a URL as a string or RegExp to [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) will automatically set `matchUrlAgainstPath` to `true`. This means that the supplied string or RegExp will be matched against the **path** if matching against the **URL** fails. Fixes [#9379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9379) and [#14256](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14256).
- Getting an alias of [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) using [cy.get()](/api/commands/get) will no longer always yield `null`. Fixes [#9306](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9306).
- [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) will now automatically responds to CORS preflight requests (HTTP `OPTIONS` requests) that match defined routes. Fixes [#9599](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9599).
- Response errors from `forceNetworkError` can now be awaited using [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) and [cy.wait()](/api/commands/wait). Fixes [#9062](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9062).
- Using [cy.log()](/api/commands/log) inside [.then()](/api/commands/then) no longer breaks the subject value in the command chain. Fixes [#8084](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8084).
- Using [Cypress.Commands.overwrite](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#Overwrite-Existing-Commands) to overwrite [.then()](/api/commands/then) now preserves the proper `this` context and sets aliases correctly. Fixes [#5101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5101).
- Using [Cypress.Commands.overwrite](/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#Overwrite-Existing-Commands) to overwrite [cy.route()](/api/commands/route) or [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) and wait on its alias now properly works. Fixes [#3890](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3890) and [#9580](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9580).
- Cypress no longer fails to find specs if you set the fixtures folder to be the same as the integration folder. Fixes [#14226](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14226).

**Misc:**

- `scrollBehavior` is now an allowed type when passed as test configuration. Addresses [#9643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9643).
- The `FileObject` type for the file argument of the `file:preprocessor` event now includes the `EventEmitter` type. Addresses [#9276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9276).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` from `11.0.2` to `11.0.3`. Addressed in [#9409](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9409).
