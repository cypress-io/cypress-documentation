## 3.8.0

_Released 12/12/2019_

**Features:**

- Chrome can now be run in headless mode by using `cypress run --headless --browser chrome`. Addresses [#832](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/832).
- Cypress now accepts a [--tag](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-tag-lt-tag-gt) argument to be used to identify separate runs. Any tags assigned will be shown on the run in the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses [#2561](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2561).
- The commands [.its()](/api/commands/its) and [.invoke()](/api/commands/invoke) now accept an `options` object to allow changing logging options. Addresses [#1450](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1450).
- Cypress will now attempt to use the `unzip` binary during `cypress install` before trying the slower, Node.js-based unzipping method. Addresses [#3803](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3803).

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where Cypress would crash on Windows when trying to pass a url through `--config` or `--env` command line flags. Fixes [#5466](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5466).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where a supplied `Cookie` header during [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) or [cy.request()](/api/commands/request) would be overwritten by the `Cookie` header generated from the browser's cookie store. Fixes [#5894](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5894).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where [cy.getCookie()](/api/commands/getcookie) would incorrectly filter cookies by their domain, leading to unexpected results. Fixes [#5656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5656).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where calling `.type({ force: true })` on hidden inputs would not type the correct characters. Fixes [#5835](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5835).
- We fixed a regression in [3.5.0](#3-5-0) where [.type()](/api/commands/type) was not respecting previous selections if the current value of the input was the same as the key. This also fixed an where [.type()](/api/commands/type) would not respect previous selections in non-selectionRange inputs (like email or number inputs). Fixes [#5703](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5703).
- During visibility checks, Cypress now properly evaluates a DOM element transformed by `scale(0)` or `rotateY(90deg)` as not visible. Fixes [#723](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/723).
- Fixed a bug where the specs list during `cypress open` would not refresh when files are changed on disk. Fixes [#5933](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5933).
- `env` configuration option displays properly within the settings panel. Previously, setting env options would incorrectly render `"undefined"` as the value. Fixes [#5859](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5859).

**Misc:**

- We removed the max viewport size and lowered min viewport size to `0` for [cy.viewport()](/api/commands/viewport) Addresses [#5871](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5871) and [#5892](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5892).
- The Test Runner now shows a non-Chrome logo for [browsers passed in via `config.browser`](/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Customize-available-browsers) that are not of the Chrome family. It also supports showing the Firefox logo (in preparation for Firefox browser support). Fixes [#5745](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5745).
- We updated the look of some of our icons. Addressed in [#5822](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/5822).
- We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses [#2690](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2690) in [#5643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/5643).
- `cy.request` will now automatically encode special characters in the request URL, including Unicode. Addresses [#5274](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5274).
- You can pass additional Electron launch command line arguments using environment variable `ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS`. Addresses [#5807](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5807).
