## 0.5.7

_Released 04/23/2015_

**Features:**

- The insanity that is URL parsing to figure out absolute, relative,
  absolute-path-relative, http, sub domains, and local files should work in most
  cases. In other words, Cypress has implemented the vast majority of url
  parsing based on the [w3c URL spec](https://url.spec.whatwg.org).

**Bugfixes:**

- Prevent reverting the DOM while tests are running. Fixes
  [#28](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28).
- Fix edge case with forced focusing / blurring an element when document is not
  in focus and the element is no longer in the DOM.
- Visiting relative paths which are served from your file system works again.
- Visiting absolute paths in the iframe now displays the correct URL in the
  address bar again.
