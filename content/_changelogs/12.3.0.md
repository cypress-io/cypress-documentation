## 12.3.0

_Released 1/03/2023_

**Features:**

- Added support for mapping the `CYPRESS_PULL_REQUEST_ID`,
  `CYPRESS_PULL_REQUEST_URL`, and/or `CYPRESS_CI_BUILD_URL` environment
  variables to the the corresponding Cloud run. This provides workarounds when
  supported CI provider mappings are incorrect or unsupported CI providers are
  used. Addressed in [#25036](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25036).
- Added new Cypress API,
  [`Cypress.currentRetry`](/api/cypress-api/currentretry), to easily access the
  current test retry count. Addresses
  [#25239](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25239).

**Performance:**

- Increased the pre-request proxy cleanup interval. The previous cleanup
  interval was too aggressive for projects loading a large number of JS modules,
  causing applications to load very slowly and in chunks. Fixed in
  [#25209](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25209).
- Fixed an issue where browsers distributed as universal binaries (Chrome,
  Firefox) on M1 Macs could be launched in the wrong architecture, resulting in
  poor performance in-browser. Fixed in
  [#25014](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25014).
- Resolved a delay that could occur on startup when using a custom Cypress
  configuration file location in projects with a transitive `typescript`
  dependency. Fixes
  [#24781](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24781).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixes an issue where component test files that contained characters, such as
  brackets (`[]`), would be ignored when running tests. This is a common pattern
  in Next.js and Gatsby.js projects. Fixes
  [#24588](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24588).
- Updated the Jenkins environment variable mappings so pull request data is
  correctly linked to the corresponding Cloud run. Fixed in
  [#25036](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25036).
- Fixed a regression in [`10.11.0`](#10-11-0) where the mocha test results no
  longer sent the pending boolean to reporters. This caused the
  [`mochaawesome`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome) reporter to
  incorrectly report pending tests as pending and skipped. Fixes
  [#24477](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24477).
- Fix for regression introduced in [`12.1.0`](#12-1-0), where
  [`.contains()`](/api/commands/contains) could return multiple elements instead
  of one element when it was matching directly on the subject, rather than on
  the subject's children. Fixes
  [#25225](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25225).
- Fixed a small visual bug in the Test Runner such that Chrome users will no
  longer see a white border on the nav bar at the specific zoom levels. Fixes
  [#25284](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25284).

**Misc**

- Remove the redundant `Need help` link from the migration information modal
  because the modal provides in-depth details for users already. Addresses
  [#21923](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21923).
- Minor UI updates were make to truncate the browser's name when it exceeds the
  allocated space and to only show the browsers's major version in the UI.
  Addresses [#21730](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21730) and
  [#21755](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21755).
- Removed the line break that was displayed on the Settings page when a
  configuration value was an empty object. Addresses
  [#21790](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21790).
