## 6.1.0

_Released 12/07/2020_

**Features:**

- There's a new `scrollBehavior` configuration option that controls the viewport position when an element is scrolled prior to action commands. Possible values are `'top'`, `'bottom'`, `'center'`, `'nearest'`, and `false`, with `'top'` being the default. `scrollBehavior: false` disables scrolling altogether. `scrollBehavior` can be specified in [global configuration](/guides/references/configuration#Actionability), [test configuration](/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Configuration) or individual [action commands](/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements) via `options`. Addresses [#871](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/871) and [#4356](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4356).
- The **Tests** tab in the Test Runner now orders folders before files. This matches the ordering of most IDEs' file explorers. Addresses [#7334](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7334).

**Bugfixes:**

- Responses stubbed from [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) will now automatically set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` to permissive values unless explicitly overridden. Fixes [#9264](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9264).
- The `Cannot read property "fireChangeEvent" of undefined` error will no longer throw during a race condition when using [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). Fixes [#9170](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9170).
- HTTP responses that cannot have a body (like HTTP 304 and HTTP 204) can now be awaited using [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept). Fixes [#8934](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8934) and [#8999](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8999).
- We fixed an issue where HTTP redirects could not be awaited using [cy.intercept()](/api/commands/intercept) unless dynamically intercepted. Addressed in [#9097](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9097).
- Tests will no longer hang in certain situations when there's an error in a `before()` hook. Fixes [#9162](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9162).
- We no longer strip `/` from URLs when they are explicitly passed with query paramaters. Fixes [#9360](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9360).

**Deprecations:**

Deprecations still work as before but will be removed from Cypress in a future release. We encourage you to update your code now to remove uses of deprecations.

- `Cypress.moment` has been deprecated and will be replaced in a future release. Consider migrating to a different datetime formatter. Addresses [#8714](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8714).

**Misc:**

- We collect more environment variables from Bitbucket to better detect reruns. Addresses [#9309](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9309).
- `waitForAnimations` and `animationDistanceThreshold` types are now included for all actionable commands. Addresses [#8854](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8854).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `mocha-junit-reporter` from `1.23.1` to `2.0.0`. Addressed in [#9528](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9528).
