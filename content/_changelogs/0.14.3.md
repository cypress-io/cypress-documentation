## 0.14.3

_Released 03/20/2016_

**Features:**

- Added [`cy.getCookies()`](/api/commands/getcookies) command for easy
  chain-ability. Fixes [#103](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/103).
- Cypress now outputs its version when passed the `--version` argument
- If you are not logged in on OSX, Cypress now issues a native system
  notification indicating to you that Cypress is running in your tray (many
  users often complained they could not tell Cypress was actually running)

**Bugfixes:**

- Handle clearing cookies better when they are created on a path other than `/`.
  Fixes [#104](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/104).
- Issuing Cypress Commands inside of a Promise now works. Fixes
  [#111](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/111).
- 'Add Project' dialog is no longer lost on blur. Fixes
  [#115](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/115).
- Desktop windows that are transparent no longer lose their box shadow.

**Misc:**

- `cy.visit()` callback functions: `onBeforeLoad` and `onLoad` are now invoked
  with the current runnables context instead of with `cy`. This makes accessing
  properties in your tests much easier.
