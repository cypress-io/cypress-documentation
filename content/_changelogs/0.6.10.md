## 0.6.10

_Released 06/06/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- Improved clicking algorithm to reduce edge cases where element could not be clicked but should have been able to be clicked.

**Misc:**

- [`.click()`](/api/commands/click) accepts `{force: true}` which will force it to issue the click event and bypass checking to ensure element is physically clickable.
- Elements which are children of a container with `overflow` are automatically scrolled prior to a click (which is an abstraction around real user behavior).
- Elements that are covering up an element you targeted for [`.click()`](/api/commands/click) are now logged out in the command console.
- All elements are now logged out as real DOM elements instead of jQuery wrapped elements. This has several upsides. Chrome will allow you to immediately interact with these elements, drilling into their contents, displaying the element box model on hover, etc. This prevents you from having to expand the jQuery elements and click "Reveal in Elements Panel".
