## 4.4.0

*Released 4/13/2020*

**Features:**

- [TypeScript](/guides/tooling/typescript-support) test files are now supported without using special preprocessors plugins. Addresses [#1859](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1859).

**Bugfixes:**

- We fixed an issue where Cypress could crash with a `This socket has been ended by the other party` error when testing applications that make use of WebSockets. Fixes [#6458](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6458).
- Uncaught errors thrown from within application or test code now display their proper stack trace. Fixes [#6964](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6964).
- Assertion errors now include a stack trace that includes the calling code. Fixes [#6969](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6969).
- We now clone the `options` object passed into Cypress commands so that they're not mutated and receive the proper `options`. Fixes [#3171](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3171).
- We fixed an issue where invalid `Set-Cookie` values could cause requests to fail with a `cannot read property key of undefined` error. Now, invalid `Set-Cookie` values will be ignored. Fixes [#6890](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6890).

**Misc:**

- Cypress no longer hides output from `cypress --version`, `cypress version`, `cypress cache path`, or `cypress cache list` commands when npm log level is `silent` or `warn`. Addresses [#2705](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2705).
- The [cy.task()](/api/commands/task) error message is now more specific about the promise resolution value required. Addresses [#6241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6241).

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `http-proxy` from `1.17.0` to `1.18.0`. Addressed in [#6934](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/6934).
