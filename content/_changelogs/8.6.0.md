## 8.6.0

_Released 10/11/2021_

**Features:**

- `cy.screenshot()` now accepts `overwrite: true` as an option to overwrite
  existing screenshots with the same file name. Addresses
  [#7955](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7955).
- `cy.select([])` can now be used to clear any selected options in a multi-value
  select. Addresses [#4318](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4318).
- Using `cy.pause()` when using `cypress run --headed --no-exit` will now pause
  a test. Addresses [#4044](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4044).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed a regression introduced in [8.2.0](#8-2-0) where certain XMLHttpRequests
  would not display their response bodies in the DevTools Console when clicked.
  Fixes [#17656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17656).
- Fixed a regression in [8.3.0](#8-3-0) where capturing videos in Chrome
  versions earlier than 89 would result in choppy videos and skipped frames.
  Fixes [#18021](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18021).
- Cypress displays the correct error when certain custom error types are thrown
  within a test. Fixes
  [#18259](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18259).
- The Cypress App will no longer crash when passed a `--spec: {}` from the CLI
  and instead error when passed an invalid object argument. Fixes

**Misc:**

- Updated the `cy.request()` error message when conflicting `failOnStatusCode`
  and `retryOnStatusCodeFailure` options are passed to be clearer. Fixes
