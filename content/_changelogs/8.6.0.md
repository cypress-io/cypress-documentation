## 8.6.0

_Released 10/11/2021_

**Features:**

  existing screenshots with the same file name. Addresses
  [#7955](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7955).
- `cy.select([])` can now be used to clear any selected options in a multi-value
  select. Addresses [#4318](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4318).
- Using `cy.pause()` when using `cypress run --headed --no-exit` will now pause
  a test. Addresses [#4044](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4044).

**Bugfixes:**

  Fixes [#17656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17656).

  Fixes [#18021](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18021).
- Cypress displays the correct error when certain custom error types are thrown
  within a test. Fixes
  [#18259](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18259).

  and instead error when passed an invalid object argument. Fixes

  to primitive value". Fixes
