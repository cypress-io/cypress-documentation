## 0.11.11

_Released 10/04/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- Snapshots of [`.type()`](/api/commands/type) and [`.select()`](/api/commands/select) are no longer incorrect due to taking snapshots too early. Fixes [#22](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22).
- Passing `{force: true}` to [`.blur()`](/api/commands/blur) now logs correctly in the Command Log.

**Misc:**

- Added delays on some tooltips.
- The URL will now highlight in a yellow background during a revert DOM snapshot.
- Moved snapshot message to be affixed to the bottom of the remote app in preparation for cycling through multiple snapshots.
- Cleaned up the URL by removing some unused content.
