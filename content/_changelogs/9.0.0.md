## 9.0.0

_Released 11/10/2021_

**Breaking Changes:**

- The `nodeVersion` configuration option now defaults to `system`. The behavior
  of the `system` option has changed to always use the Node.js binary/version
  that launched Cypress. If Cypress was not launched via the terminal, Cypress
  will use the `bundled` Node.js version. This could change the behavior of code
  within your `pluginsFile` since it may be run in your `system` Node.js
  version. Addresses
  [#18684](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18684).
- Windows 32-bit is no longer supported in Cypress. Addresses
  [#17962](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17962).
- An error will now be thrown if an invalid value is passed to `Cypress.config`.
  Previously invalid values were ignored and could cause unexpected behavior.
  Addresses [#18589](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18589).
- `cy.contains()` no longer yields the `<body>` element when it matches the
  content of `<script>` or `<style>` tags. Addresses
  [#14861](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14861).
- Attempting to add an existing built-in Cypress command using
  `Cypress.Commands.add()` will now throw an error, indicating that
  `Cypress.Commands.overwrite()` should be used instead to overwrite the
  behavior of existing commands. Addresses
  [#18572](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18572).
- Custom command implementations are now typed based on the declared custom
  chainables. Addresses
  [#17496](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/17496).
- The bundled Node.js version was upgraded from `14.17.0` to `16.5.0`. This
  could change the behavior of code within the `pluginsFile` when using the
  bundled Node.js version of Cypress. Addressed in
  [#18317](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18317).
- The default read behavior of a fixture provided as a static response in
  `cy.intercept()` changed from being read as a Buffer to using `utf8` encoding.
  This aligns the default read behavior of `cy.intercept()` to `cy.readFile()`
  and `cy.fixture()`. Addresses
  [#18534](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18534).

**Deprecations:**

- The `nodeVersion` configuration option has been deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release.

**Features:**

- When `null` is passed as the encoding to `cy.readFile()` or `cy.fixture()`,
  the file is treated as binary and read as a Buffer. Similarly, `null` passed
  as the encoding to `cy.writeFile()` allows direct writing of buffers. If the
  encoding is unspecified, the default remains `utf8`, matching the current
  behavior. Addresses
  [#18534](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18534).

**Bugfixes:**

- Sticky elements within a fixed container will now be able to be properly
  scrolled to during action commands. Fixes
  [#4233](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4233).
- `document.referrer` will now correctly reflect the correct value from the
  application under test after `cy.visit()`. Fixes
  [#4295](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4295).

**Dependencies:**

- Upgraded Chrome browser version used during `cypress run` and when selecting
  Electron browser in `cypress open` from `91` to `94`. Addressed in
  [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18317).
- Upgraded bundled Node.js version from `14.17.0` to `16.5.0`. Addressed in
  [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18317).
- Upgraded `electron` from `14.1.0` to `15.2.0`. Addressed in
  [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18317).
