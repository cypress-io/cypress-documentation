## 1.1.4

_Released 12/6/2017_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue causing `Chrome` to timeout when attempted to be run through
  our docker containers. Fixes
  [#1031](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1031).
- Several TypeScript typings were added, updated and fixed. Fixes
  [#1006](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1006).
- Using a regular `http://` URL now works when using the
  `CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION` flag to point the binary at an external location.
  Fixes [#1001](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1001).
- File watching is fixed (again) when changing between specs. Fixes
  [#1018](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1018).

**Misc:**

- There is now a new
  [`CYPRESS_SKIP_BINARY_INSTALL`](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Skipping-installation)
  flag you can pass during `npm install` which skips the binary installation
  after the `cypress` npm module completes its installation. Fixes
  [#1005](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1005).
- We now launch Chrome with `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-gpu` options in Linux.
  We will soon release a new plugin event that enables you to modify the browser
  arguments we use by default. This _shouldn't_ cause issues with existing Linux
  users, and instead it should fix many CI setups that were using our Docker
  containers or your own home grown installed Chrome setup. Fixes
  [#1021](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1021) and
  [#1020](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1020).
- Removed several aliases from our browser detector. These were not implemented
  properly and not needed - and thus only caused indirection. Fixes
  [#1023](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1023).
