## 1.1.4

*Released 12/6/2017*

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an issue causing `Chrome` to timeout when attempted to be run through our docker containers. Fixes [#1031](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1031).
- Several TypeScript typings were added, updated and fixed. Fixes [#1006](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1006).
- Using a regular `http://` URL now works when using the `CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION` flag to point the binary at an external location. Fixes [#1001](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1001).
- File watching is fixed (again) when changing between specs. Fixes [#1018](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1018).

**Misc:**

- There is now a new [`CYPRESS_SKIP_BINARY_INSTALL`](/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Skipping-installation) flag you can pass during `npm install` which skips the binary installation after the `cypress` npm module completes its installation. Fixes [#1005](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1005).
- We now launch Chrome with `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-gpu` options in Linux. We will soon release a new plugin event that enables you to modify the browser arguments we use by default. This *shouldn't* cause issues with existing Linux users, and instead it should fix many CI setups that were using our Docker containers or your own home grown installed Chrome setup. Fixes [#1021](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1021) and [#1020](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1020).
- Removed several aliases from our browser detector. These were not implemented properly and not needed - and thus only caused indirection. Fixes [#1023](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1023).
