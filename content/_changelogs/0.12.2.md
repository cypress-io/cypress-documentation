## 0.12.2

_Released 11/01/2015_

**Features:**

- There is now a `cy.cmd` and `cy.command` method which enables you to invoke
  commands by their string name. This is most useful when using _namespaced_
  custom commands. So `Cypress.addParentCommand("dashboard.setSlider", ...)` can
  be accessed by `cy.cmd("dashboard.setSlider", arg1, arg2)`. (Docs have not
  been written yet).
- `Environment Variable` support has been added and can be accessed in your
  tests with [`Cypress.env`](/api/cypress-api/env). The docs have been written
  [Environment Variable](/guides/guides/environment-variables) and
  [here](/api/cypress-api/env).

**Misc:**

- The URL property on all XHR's is now completely decoded, even on URLs which
  were originally encoded. The reason is for easier assertions and debugging.
  This URL property is specific to Cypress and does not actually affect the
  underlying XHR.
