## 3.1.5

_Released 1/30/2019_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed issue where the `onLoad` event was never being called when calling [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) on the url Cypress is currently navigated to. Fixes [#1311](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1311).
- Fixed regression introduced in `3.1.4` that caused an `InvalidStateError` when visiting a page with an XHR request with a `responseType` other than `text` or `''`. Fixes [#3008](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3008).
- Fixed several issues in Chrome\* versions >= 72 in the Cypress proxy that caused using `cy.visit()` with `localhost` to fail, or using `localhost` inside of the `baseUrl` configuration option. Fixes [#1872](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1872) and [#3252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3252) and [#1777](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1777).
- Fixed another issue in Chrome\* versions >= 72 where a scrollable command log would cause the entire application to be scrollable. Fixes [#3253](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3253).
- Fixed not correctly passing the `timeout` option for [cy.request()](/api/commands/request). This should fix some instances where large `timeout` values would cause `ESOCKETTIMEDOUT` errors. Fixes [#2669](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2669).
- Fixed issue where Cypress would inject a script tag before the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration when the document only contained the doctype declaration. Fixes [#2617](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2617).
- The error message when visiting a site with an invalid content-type now prints the correct content-type of the response Cypress received from the web server. Fixes [#3101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3101).
- Fixed issue where an internal `layout.html` file would inadvertently get loaded instead of the spec file. Fixes [#2891](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2891).
- Fixed issue where the Chromium browser was not detected in Linux due to Cypress not distinguishing between Chrome and Chromium browsers with the same version. Fixes [#1400](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1400).
- Fixed issue of Cypress being unable to play videos with `autoplay`. We now pass the `--no-user-gesture-required` command line switch to Chrome. Fixes [#2376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2376).
- We now pass the Chromium command line switches `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream` and `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream` to Chrome by default in order to better support testing webcam functionality. Fixes [#2704](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2704).
- Updated filenames allowed for screenshots to allow more characters that are valid. Fixes [#3052](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3052).
- Fixed TypeScript error caused by `dtslint` dependency introduced in 3.1.4. Fixes [#3024](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3024) and [#3136](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3136).
- Improved error message displayed for `cypress cache` to not display `[object Object]` and made `--help` labels more descriptive. Fixes [#2589](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2589).
- Using [.clear()](/api/commands/clear) on inputs of type 'date' is now working. Fixes [#2738](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2738)
- Fixed issue where `event` was undefined when using an `onload` event handler. Fixed [#2859](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2859)
