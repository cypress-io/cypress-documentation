## 3.0.3

_Released 7/30/2018_

**Bugfixes:**

- Reverted the Chrome argument that disabled `RootLayerScrolling` which was used
  to prevent the application under test from "shaking" due to a bug in versions
  66 and 67. This workaround inadvertently created a different and much more
  severe bug in Chrome 68 that would miscalculate pointer coordinates. This led
  to Cypress giving confusing errors about elements being covered up on action.
  This is still a bug in Chrome, and is fixed in Canary but has not yet been
  released to the stable Chrome 68 channel. Nevertheless, removing the
  `RootLayerScrolling` flag does fix it. We did several experiments to try to
  ensure that the "shaking" behavior does not exhibit itself in Chrome 68. We
  have limited the `--disable-blink-features=RootLayerScrolling` flag to Chrome
  66 and Chrome 67. Fixes
  [#2223](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2223) and
  [#2215](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2215) and
  [#2037](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2037).
- Fixed another bug with Chrome that caused the `chromeWebSecurity: false`
  option to not be respected. This was due to Chrome progressively rolling out
  trials of a new option that attempts to isolate sites (and iframes) in their
  own child process if their origins are different. Fixes
  [#1951](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1951) and
  [#2001](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2001) and
  [#715](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/715).
- Fixed Cypress hanging in CI due to excessive and unnecessary globbing. We
  finally tracked down this issue which made it appear as if Cypress was
  "hanging" after closing a spec file and then attempting to open the next one.
  Fixes [#2183](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2183) and
  [#1905](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1905) and
  [#1912](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1912).
- We are now properly serializing nested object arguments when using the
  [Module API](/guides/guides/module-api) via `cypress.open()` or
  `cypress.run()`. Passing nested objects in `reporterOptions` now works
  correctly. This is especially useful when using `mocha-multi-reporters`. In
  addition to fixing the [Module API](/guides/guides/module-api), we are now
  also properly handling nested arguments from the
  [Command Line](/guides/guides/command-line). In order to pass nested objects
  within CLI params you must pass stringified JSON. This is useful for
  properties such as `blacklistHosts`. Fixes
  [#1348](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1348) and
  [#1357](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1357) and
  [#2221](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2221).
- Fixed a bug causing screenshots saved via
  [cy.screenshot()](/api/commands/screenshot) to be in different folders when
  you ran using [cypress open](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) vs
  [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) . Fixes
  [#2091](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2091).
- Fixed bugs with Electron losing focus when running headlessly via
  [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) after navigation. Now
  the browser will always act as if it is focused no matter what and in all
  situations when running headlessly. If you were seeing focus related problems
  when running headlessly, this should fix them. Fixes issue
  [#2190](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2190).
- Fixed using when using [cy.click()](/api/commands/click) on an element that
  bound to the `focus` event while the browser was currently _out of focus_. We
  have now normalized **all focus and blur events** to behave the same as if the
  browser is always in focus. This should fix the other batch of `blur` and
  `focus` issues that users have been experiencing. Fixes
  [#549](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/549) and
  [#2198](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2198).
- Fixed the vast majority of known issues with [.type()](/api/commands/type).
  Fixes [#1241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1241).
- Using [.type()](/api/commands/type) on an input of type `email` or `number`
  will no longer fire unnecessary additional `blur` and `focus` events. Fixes
  [#2210](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2210).
- Fixed [.type()](/api/commands/type) breaking on chains when passing the same
  `options` references. Fixes
  [#365](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/365).
- Fixed an issue with [.clear()](/api/commands/clear) not behaving the same as
  `cy.type('{selectall}{backspace}')`. Fixes
  [#420](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/420).
- Fixed a bug with issuing an additional `blur` and `click` event when chaining
  `.clear().type(...)`. Fixes
  [#593](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/593).
- Fixed many issues with typing into `[contenteditable]` elements. WYSIWYG,
  [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) based, and other HTML editors now work
  correctly. Fixes [#596](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/596) and
  [#1686](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1686) and
  [#2096](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2096).
- The caret now correctly moves on `[contenteditable]` elements. Fixes
  [#1108](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1108).
- Fixed [.type()](/api/commands/type) inserting a rogue `<br>` tag after the
  first letter in `[contenteditable]` elements. Fixes
  [#1926](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1926).
- Fixed issue where change events with [.type()](/api/commands/type) would not
  fire correctly for many more situations and edge cases. Fixes
  [#651](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/651).
- Fixed issues with typing into JS based text-mask plugins. Basically anything
  that would alter the `.value` in response to certain events now works
  correctly. Fixes [#940](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/940) and
  [#1684](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1684).
- Using [.clear()](/api/commands/clear) on an input with a `maxlength` attribute
  now works. Fixes [#1002](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1002)
  and [#2056](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2056).
- Fixed issues with [.type()](/api/commands/type) not firing the `change` event
  on `input[type=number]`. Fixes
  [#1171](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1171).
- Fixed other event related issues with [.type()](/api/commands/type) that were
  not firing correctly. Fixes
  [#1209](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1209).
- Fixed even more issues with [.type()](/api/commands/type) not inserting
  characters on `input[type=number]`. Fixes
  [#1381](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1381).
- Fixed not being able to type negative numbers into `input[type=number]`
  elements. Fixes [#2173](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2173).
- Fixed `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd` with [.type()](/api/commands/type)
  when using `{leftarrow}` or `{rightarrow}`. Fixes
  [#1234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1234).
- Fixed not being able to type into a `datetime-local` input. Fixes
  [#1366](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1366).
- Calling [.focus()](/api/commands/focus) or [.blur()](/api/commands/blur) on
  [cy.window()](/api/commands/window) no longer fires blur events on the
  `activeElement` or causes it to become `body`. Fixes
  [#2234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2234).
- Using `cy.get('body').click()` now correctly changes the `activeElement` back
  to `body` and causes the existing `activeElement` to receive `blur`. Fixes
  [#2236](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2236).

**Misc:**

- We've loosened up the restrictions surrounding what we consider a typeable
  element. You can now type into inputs with invalid `type` attributes because
  the browser does still consider them regular `text` inputs and allows you to
  type into them. Fixes
  [#586](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/586).
- Using `{uparrow}` or `{downarrow}` with [.type()](/api/commands/type) on an
  `input[type=number]` element now increments or decrements the number
  configured via the `step` attribute. Fixes
  [#2110](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2110).
- Using `{uparrow}` or `{downarrow}` with [.type()](/api/commands/type) now
  correctly moves the cursor on `textarea` or `[contenteditable]` elements.
  Fixes [#2187](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2187).
- You can now use [.focus()](/api/commands/focus) or
  [.blur()](/api/commands/blur) on `cy.get('body')`. Fixes
  [#2235](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2235).
- Bumped the version in `junit` reporter dep from `1.12.1` to `1.17.0` which
  adds a few new features. Fixes
  [#2238](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2238).
- Bumped deps that `npm audit` was yelling about. Fixes
  [#1701](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1701).
- Runs showing up in the `Runs` tab now more closely match how they display in
  the Dashboard. Fixes
  [#2060](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2060).
- Added more debug logs. Fixes
  [#2108](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2108).
- When recording to the Dashboard we now more accurately collect commit details
  when it is missing from the local `git` data. Fixes
  [#2129](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2129) and
  [#2073](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2073).
- Updated build in example kitchen sink to `1.0.2`. Fixes
  [#2139](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2139).
- Updated the json-schema describing `videoCompression`. Allowing it to be a
  boolean. Fixes [#2140](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2140).
