## 0.10.5

_Released 08/13/2015_

**Bugfixes:**

- Running a specific test won't open/close immediately when starting up (fixes weird flickering effect).
- [`.check()`](/api/commands/check) and [`.uncheck()`](/api/commands/uncheck) commands will now correctly "end" even if they were `noop` due to the element already being in a checked or unchecked state.

**Misc:**

- Currently running tests now displays a spinner to indicate they are currently running.
- Optimized performance of command lists.
- Commands which were silenced with `{log: false}` will now always display in the Command Log if they were part of a replayed chain of commands due to an alias reference becoming stale. Previously they would not display which was very confusing.
- Sinon.JS is no longer minified.
