## 10.2.1

_Released 6/24/2022_

**Bugfixes:**

  containing base64 encoded files unnecessarily. Fixed

  [#22462](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22462).

  [#20685](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20685).
- Fixed a 9.x to 10.x migration bug where the migration tool would hang without
  a response when it attempted to read the `pluginsFile` contents when the
  `pluginsFile` value was a directory path instead of a relative file path.
  Fixed
- Fixed the process profiler to output Cypress's summarized CPU and memory
  metrics when the `cypress:server:util:process_profiler` debug stream is
  enabled. Fixed [#22022](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22022).

  in the Cypress runner. Fixes

  filter specs in the Cypress runner. Fixes
