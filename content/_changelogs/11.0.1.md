## 11.0.1

_Released 11/09/2022_

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed an 11.0.0 regression that caused enabling `experimentalSessionAndOrigin`
  to throw a webpack error. Fixes
  [#24611](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24611)
- Fixed an 11.0.0 regression where using custom reporters would cause Cypress to
  throw a 'Cannot find module' error. Fixes
  [#24607](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24607)
- Fixed `testIsolation` configuration validation to allow configuration updates
  without restarting Cypress. Fixes
  [#24497](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24497).
- Fixed an issue where `cy.origin()` would not prevent users from setting up
  `same-superdomain-origin` `cy.origin()` blocks. In these cases `cy.origin()`
  is not required and users would be better served by not using the command.
  Fixes [#24169](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24169)
- Fixed an 11.0.0 regression where modifying the currently loaded component
  testing spec in open mode does not trigger a rerun of the spec. Fixed by
  [#24630](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24630)
