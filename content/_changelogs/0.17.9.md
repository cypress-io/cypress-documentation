## 0.17.9

_Released 10/22/2016_

**Bugfixes:**

- Cypress now applies cookies to the browser which were cleared between
  redirects. Fixes [#224](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/224).
- Snapshots now work even when `<html>` tag has invalid attributes. Fixes
  [#271](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/271).
- Cypress no longer crashes on initial [`cy.visit()`](/api/commands/visit) when
  the 3rd party web server never ends the response. Fixes
  [#272](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/272).

**Misc:**

- Changed default [`responseTimeout`](/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts)
  from `20000` to `30000`.
- Changed default [`pageLoadTimeout`](/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts)
  from `30000` to `60000`.
- The internal Cypress proxy now forcibly responds to requests taking longer
  than `responseTimeout`. Currently this sends back `text/html` with the
  `ETIMEDOUT` error, but this likely needs to be configurable. The reason we are
  now forcibly applying timeouts is to prevent `socket pooling exhaustion` where
  tests are running and a 3rd party server never responds to the request.
