## 0.11.12

_Released 10/07/2015_

**Features:**

- Snapshots can now be named and a command can have multiple snapshots.
- Multiple snapshots are now cycled automatically on hover, and the name of the snapshot is displayed.
- Most of the action commands now take multiple snapshots (giving you a precise look at an action prior to it happening, and then afterwards).

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed situation where an `Uncaught Error` was not being properly handled. Cypress would incorrectly continue to retry commands instead of canceling them, which lead to incorrect errors downstream in other tests.
- Fixed situation where an error being thrown from an XHR was being improperly handled (in a slightly different way than the problem above).
- Stopped sending CI data when [cypress run](/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) was issued.

**Misc:**

- CSS Improvements
