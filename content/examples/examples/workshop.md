## End-to-end Testing with Cypress.io

<DocsImage src="/img/examples/end-to-end-testing-workshop.jpg" alt="End-to-end Testing Workshop" ></DocsImage>

Cypress has put together a full day workshop that teaches how to test a modern
web application using Cypress. You can preview the slides here:
[testing-workshop-cypress.netlify.app/](https://testing-workshop-cypress.netlify.app/)

The repository
[cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress)
has:

- An example application
- Test exercises (with answers)
- Speaker slides with notes

The content should be a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn
Cypress or teach it to others. The exercises cover the following topics (see the
workshop's
[README file](https://github.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress#readme) for
a full list).

- How to install and run Cypress
- Writing and running a basic test
- Setting up video recording and screenshots
- Using the Selector Playground
- Testing XHR requests
- Using data fixtures to mock data
- Running tests on CI and recording to the Dashboard
- Customizing your own reporters
- Writing custom Cypress commands
- Debugging in Cypress
- Component testing

We hope this testing workshop proves itself useful in teaching developers and
testers good Cypress practices.

## ReactJSDay 2019 Testing Course

<DocsImage src="/img/examples/reactjsday-course.png" alt="ReactJS Day" ></DocsImage>

This is the
[reference repository](https://github.com/NoriSte/reactjsday-2019-testing-course)
with all the contents and the examples of the
[React Testing 101: component, integration, and end-to-end testing](https://2019.reactjsday.it/workshops/react-testing-101.html)
course for the [ReactJSDay 2019](https://2019.reactjsday.it/) conference.

The repository aims to be consumed through
[the compiled GitBook](https://noriste.github.io/reactjsday-2019-testing-course/).
The course starts from the top of the testing pyramid and goes down instead of
following the "standard" testing path, you can
[read here](https://noriste.github.io/reactjsday-2019-testing-course/book/top-to-bottom.html)
the reason why.
[Some introductory slides](https://slides.com/noriste/reactjsday-2019-testing-course)
are also included but they're only useful for the teacher. They're a summary of
the content presented before the coding session.

Requisites to run the project and the tests on your local machine:

- Node 10+
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
