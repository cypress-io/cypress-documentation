# Cypress Remark Plugins for Docs

This "package" contains a few remark plugins for creating and populating content
variations in Tabs/code-blocks for Cypress config samples.

This is developed as a separate package so it can be in TS and have its own
tests/builds outside of the main docs.

To build run `yarn build`

To test run `yarn test`

Visit each plugins readme for docs on each individual plugin.
