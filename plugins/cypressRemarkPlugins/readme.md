# Cypress Remark Plugins for  Docs

This "package" contains a few remark plugins for creating Tabs/code-blocks for
Cypress config samples.

This is developed as a separate package so it can be in TS and have its own
tests/builds outside of the main docs.

To build run `yarn build`

To test run `yarn test`
